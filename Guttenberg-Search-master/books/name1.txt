Corporate Governance Guidelines - Investor Relations - Alphabet
Corporate Governance Guidelines
I.Introduction
These Corporate Governance Guidelines are established by the Board of Directors of Alphabet to provide a structure within which our directors and management can eectively pursue Alphabetâs objectives for the benet of its stockholders. The Board intends that these guidelines serve as a exible framework within which the Board may conduct its business, not as a set of binding legal obligations. These guidelines should be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws, Alphabetâs charter documents and other governing legal documents and Alphabetâs policies.
II. Board Structure and Composition
1.Size of the Board. The authorized number of directors will be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board, provided the Board consists of at least ve members.
2.Board Membership Criteria. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate candidates for membership on the Board, including candidates nominated or recommended by stockholders, in light of criteria established by the Board, and recommend to the Board the slate of nominees for election at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders or nominees for election to ll interim vacancies on the Board. Given the global and complex nature of Alphabetâs business, the Board believes it is important to consider diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, cultural background, and professional experiences in evaluating candidates. Accordingly, when evaluating candidates for nomination as new directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider (and will ask any search rm that it engages to provide) a set of candidates that includes both underrepresented people of color and dierent genders.
3.Director Independence. A majority of directors on the Board will be independent as required by the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board also believes that it is often in the best interest of Alphabet and its stockholders to have non-independent directors, including current and (in some cases) former members of management, serve as directors. Each independent Director who experiences a change in circumstances that could aect such Directorâs independence should deliver a notice of such change to Alphabetâs Secretary.

4.Director Tenure. Directors are re-elected each year and the Board does not believe it should establish term limits because directors who have developed increasing insight into Alphabet and its operations over time provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. To ensure the Board continues to generate new ideas and to operate eectively, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall monitor performance and take steps as necessary regarding continuing director tenure.
5.Directors Who Change Their Present Job Responsibility. Any Director who experiences a material change in his/her job responsibilities or the position he/she held when he/she came on the Board should deliver a notice of such change in status to the Chairman of the Board and/or the Lead Independent Director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then evaluate whether the individual continues to satisfy the Boardâs membership criteria in light of his/her new occupational status and shall recommend to the Board the action, if any, to be taken with respect to such individual.
III. Principal Duties of the Board of Directors
1.To Oversee Management and Evaluate Strategy. The fundamental responsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably believe to be the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders. It is the duty of the Board to oversee managementâs performance to ensure that Alphabet operates in an eective, ecient and ethical manner in order to produce value for Alphabetâs stockholders. The Board also evaluates Alphabetâs overall strategy and monitors Alphabetâs performance against its operating plan and against the performance of its peers.
Additionally, the Board has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant board committees. The Board is responsible for oversight of strategic, nancial and execution risks and exposures associated with Alphabetâs business strategy, product innovation and sales road map, policy matters, signicant litigation and regulatory exposures, and other current matters that may present material risk to Alphabetâs or its subsidiariesâ or controlled aliatesâ nancial performance, operations, infrastructure, plans, prospects or reputation, acquisitions and divestitures.
Directors are expected to invest the time and eort necessary to understand Alphabetâs business and nancial strategies and challenges. The basic duties of the directors include attending Board meetings and actively participating in Board discussions. Directors are also expected to make themselves available outside of board meetings for advice and consultation.
