AMENDED AND RESTATED 
BYLAWS OF ALPHABET INC.   
  ARTICLE I
 CORPORATE OFFICES  1.1 REGISTERED OFFICE. 
The registered office of Alphabet Inc. shall be fixed in the corporations certificate of incorporation, as the same may be amended and/or
restated from time to time (as so amended and/or restated, the Certificate).  1.2 OTHER OFFICES. 
The corporations Board of Directors (the Board) may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where
the corporation is qualified to do business.  ARTICLE II  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
2.1 PLACE OF MEETINGS.  Meetings
of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as designated by the Board. The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL). In the absence of any such designation or determination, stockholders meetings shall be held
at the corporations principal executive office.  2.2 ANNUAL MEETING. 
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board. At the annual meeting, directors
shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.  2.3 SPECIAL MEETING. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate, special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time, for any purpose or
purposes, only by (i) the Board, (ii) the Chairman of the Board, (iii) the chief executive officer of the corporation, or (iv) holders of more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the corporation then entitled to vote.  If any person(s) other than the Board calls a special meeting, the request shall:
 (i) be in writing;  (ii)
specify the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted; and 
  -1- 


(iii) be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by facsimile transmission to the
secretary of the corporation.  Upon receipt of such a request, the Board shall determine the date, time and place of such special meeting,
which must be scheduled to be held on a date that is within ninety (90) days of receipt by the secretary of the request therefor, and the secretary of the corporation shall prepare a proper notice thereof. No business may be transacted at such
special meeting other than the business specified in the notice to stockholders of such meeting.  2.4 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS
MEETINGS.  All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with either Section 2.5 or
Section 8.1 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The notice shall
specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and, unless the Certificate provides otherwise, any special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled by resolution duly
adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. 
Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful,
the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held
without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 
Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any stockholder to whom
(a) notice of two (2) consecutive annual meetings, or (b) all, and at least two (2) payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a twelve
(12) month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at such persons address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth such
persons then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. 
  -2- 


The exception in subsection (a) of the above paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission.  2.5 MANNER OF
GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE.  Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given: 
(i) if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on
the corporations records;  (ii) if electronically transmitted, as provided in Section 8.1 of these bylaws; or 
(iii) otherwise, when delivered. 
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or of the transfer agent or any other agent of the corporation that
the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.  Notice may be
waived in accordance with Section 7.13 of these bylaws.  2.6 QUORUM. 
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate or required by law, stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the corporation, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. If such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of
the stockholders, then the chairman of the meeting, or the stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the capital stock at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a
duly called meeting at which quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. 
2.7 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE. 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting
if the time, place if any thereof, and the means of remote communications if any by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the continuation of the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 and 2.5 of these bylaws. 
  -3- 


2.8 ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEETING. 
Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chairman of the Board or, in the absence thereof, by such person as the chairman of the
Board shall appoint, or, in the absence thereof or in the event that the chairman shall fail to make such appointment, any officer of the corporation elected by the Board. In the absence of the secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the
meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.  The Board shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint
one (1) or more inspector(s), who may include individual(s) who serve the corporation in other capacities, including without limitation as officers, employees or agents, to act at the meeting of stockholders and make a written report thereof.
The Board may designate one (1) or more persons as alternate inspector(s) to replace any inspector, who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting
shall appoint one (1) or more inspector(s) to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his or her ability. The inspector(s) or alternate(s) shall have the duties prescribed pursuant to Section 231 of the DGCL or other applicable law. 
The Board shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary,
appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are
necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, including without limitation establishing an agenda of business of the meeting, rules or regulations to maintain order, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time
fixed for commencement thereof and the fixing of the date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting (and shall announce such at the meeting). 
2.9 VOTING.  The stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock)
and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.  Except as otherwise provided in the provisions
of Section 213 of the DGCL (relating to the fixing of a date for determination of stockholders of record) or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to that number of votes for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder as
set forth in the Certificate.  In all matters, other than the election of directors and except as otherwise required by law, the
Certificate or these bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
  -4- 


The stockholders of the corporation shall not have the right to cumulate their votes for the
election of directors of the corporation.  2.10 NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING. 
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation (if the corporation has more than one stockholder at such
time) must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. 
2.11 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS. 
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the
Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other such action.  If the Board does not fix a record date in
accordance with these bylaws and applicable law:  (i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. 
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action
by the Board is necessary, shall be the first day on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation. 
(iii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
  -5- 


2.12 PROXIES. 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy
authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a
longer period. A stockholder may also authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it as proxy in the manner(s) provided under Section 212(c) of the DGCL or as otherwise provided under Delaware law. The revocability of a proxy
that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.  2.13 LIST OF
STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten
(10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting
for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or
(ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporations principal place of business.  In the event that the corporation
determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list
shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 
2.14 ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS. 
Only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation. To be
properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board, or (c) a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL that has been properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for
in this Section 2.14 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14. For such business to be
considered properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder such stockholder must, in addition to any other applicable requirements, have given timely notice in proper form of such stockholders intent to bring such business before such
meeting. To be timely, such stockholders notice must 
  -6-

preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or

  -19- 



summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided
in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will
furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.  7.5 LOST CERTIFICATES. 
Except as provided in this Section 7.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless
the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. 
7.6 CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS. 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction
of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term person includes both a corporation and a natural person. 
7.7 DIVIDENDS.  The Board,
subject to any restrictions contained in either (i) the DGCL, or (ii) the Certificate, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporations
capital stock.  The Board may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any
proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve.  7.8 FISCAL YEAR. 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board and may be changed by the Board. 
7.9 SEAL.  The corporation may
adopt a corporate seal, which shall be adopted and which may be altered by the Board. The corporation may use the corporate seal by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 
  -20- 


7.10 TRANSFER OF STOCK. 
Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the corporation kept at an office of the corporation or by transfer agents
designated to transfer shares of the stock of the corporation. Except where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 7.5 of these bylaws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved shall be surrendered for
cancellation before a new certificate is issued therefore. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority
to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books. 
7.11 STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS. 
The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes or series
of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes or series owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL. 
7.12 REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS. 
The corporation:  (i) shall be
entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner; 
(ii) shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments on partly paid shares the person registered on its books as the owner of
shares; and  (iii) shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.  7.13
WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, a written
waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance
of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting solely for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission
unless so required by the Certificate or these bylaws. 
  -21- 


7.14 CHARITABLE FOUNDATION. 
The establishment by the corporation of a charitable foundation will require Board approval, as will contributions by the corporation to the
foundation and disbursements by the foundation. The Board may delegate authority over the foundation to one or more persons who are not directors of the corporation with the approval of two-thirds of the
members of the Board.  ARTICLE VIII  NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION 
8.1 NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. 
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate or these
bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is
given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: 
(i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such
consent; and  (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or
other person responsible for the giving of notice.  However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any
meeting or other action.  Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 
(i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 
(ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 
(iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of
(A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and  (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when
directed to the stockholder.  An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the
corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 
  -22- 


8.2 DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. 
An electronic transmission means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates
a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 
8.3 INAPPLICABILITY.  Notice by
a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (renewal,
revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (attachment of shares of stock) of the DGCL. 
ARTICLE IX  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
9.1 POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN THOSE BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. 
Subject to Section 9.3 of this Article IX, the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or
hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the corporation or any predecessor of the corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the
corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was unlawful. 
9.2 POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. 
Subject to Section 9.3 of this Article IX, the corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or
hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such
person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the 
  -23- 



corporation or any predecessor of the corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such
action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter
as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 
9.3 AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. 
Any indemnification under this Article IX (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Article IX, as the
case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement
to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the corporation. To the
extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such
person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 
9.4 GOOD FAITH DEFINED.  For
purposes of any determination under Section 9.3 of this Article IX, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on the records or
books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or
another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with

  -24- 



reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The term another enterprise as used in this Section 9.4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 9.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive
or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of this Article IX, as the case may be. 
9.5 INDEMNIFICATION BY A COURT. 
Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 9.3 of this Article IX, and notwithstanding the absence
of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Article IX. The basis of such
indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of
this Article IX, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 9.3 of this Article IX nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a
presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be given to the corporation promptly upon the
filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application. 
9.6 EXPENSES PAYABLE IN ADVANCE. 
To the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law, expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or
officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding; provided, however, that if the DGCL
requires, an advance of expenses incurred by any person in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article IX.  9.7
NONEXCLUSIVITY OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate, any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 9.1
and 9.2 of this Article IX shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this 
  -25- 



Article IX shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 9.1 or 9.2 of this Article IX but whom the corporation has the power or
obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and
advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.  9.8 INSURANCE. 
To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX. 
9.9 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  For
purposes of this Article IX, references to the corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger
which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of
such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the
same position under the provisions of this Article IX with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this
Article IX, references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the corporation shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the corporation as
referred to in this Article IX.  9.10 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. 
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article IX shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be
a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal and legal representatives of such a person. 
  -26- 


9.11 LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IX to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which
shall be governed by Section 9.5 hereof), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized or consented to by the board of directors of the corporation.  9.12 INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. 
The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the corporation similar to those conferred in this Article IX to directors and officers of the corporation. 
9.13 EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL. 
Neither any amendment or repeal of any Section of this Article IX, nor the adoption of any provision of the Certificate or the bylaws
inconsistent with this Article IX, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or other agent established pursuant to this Article IX existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of an
inconsistent provision, including without limitation by eliminating or reducing the effect of this Article IX, for or in respect of any act, omission or other matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for
this Article IX, would accrue or arise), prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.  ARTICLE X
 AMENDMENTS  The bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the voting power of the
stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate, also confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the Board. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board shall not divest the
stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.  *  *  *  *  *
