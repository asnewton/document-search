Dear
Shareholders: 
It
is my pleasure to inform you that our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be conducted online on Thursday, May 9, 2019, starting at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The virtual nature of the
meeting will continue to enable increased shareholder accessibility, while improving meeting efficiency and reducing costs. Shareholders will be able to listen, vote, and submit questions from their
home or any remote location with Internet connectivity. Information on how to participate in this year's virtual meeting can be found on page 87. 
In
2018 we took aggressive steps to improve the efficiency and focus of our traditional automotive business. Equally important we accelerated our efforts to be a leader in the mobility services of
tomorrow. While 2018 was challenging, we still achieved our ninth consecutive year of solid earnings and positive operating-related cash flow. These profits enabled us to distribute
$3.1 billion to our shareholders last year, and $18.4 billion since 2012. 
As
we strengthen our product portfolio we are committed to reducing vehicle emissions by delivering CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris Climate Accord. We are investing
$11 billion in electrification to deliver 40 new hybrid and electric vehicles globally by 2022. 
Looking
farther into the future, the actions we are taking to improve efficiencies are freeing up capital to invest in emerging businesses. We expect to invest $4 billion in our autonomous
vehicle efforts through 2023, including our $1 billion investment in Argo AI. 
As
we move into the 21st century we are reimagining what mobility will look like beyond the privately owned internal combustion engine automobile. That means not just smart cars,
but also smart roads, smart parking, and smart public transit systems, all talking to one another. It means rethinking cities so that even as millions more people move to cities the air is cleaner,
the streets less congested and everyone has access to efficient, affordable and sustainable mobility. 
Since
the days of the Model T people have trusted us to get them where they want to go, do what is right for them and make their lives better. Whatever form mobility takes in the future, our Board of
Directors, leadership team and extended family of employees are determined to continue earning your trust as we strive to become the world's most trusted company designing smart vehicles for a smart
world. 
Thank
you for your support of our efforts. 
March 29, 2019

*A
Performance Unit is an award of the right to earn up to a certain number of shares of common stock, Restricted Stock Units, or cash, or a combination of cash and
shares of common stock or Restricted Stock Units, based on performance against specified goals established by the Compensation Committee under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. A Time-Based Restricted
Stock Unit ("Time-Based Unit") represents the right to receive a share of common stock, or cash equivalent to the value of a share of common stock, when the restriction period ends, under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee.

Our compensation practices have been consistently supported by shareholders, as evidenced by recent Say-on-Pay results. 



We
regularly meet with investors and consider any concerns shared with us. For instance, in 2015 we made significant changes to our Performance Unit program that addressed investor comments. 









 Named Executives' compensation is tied to our 2018 and 2016-2018 performance periods 
 80% of our Named Executives' target compensation is performance-based 
 We added a gender pay equity statement to our Global Compensation and Benefits Philosophy, Strategy, and Guiding Principles 



 Executive stock ownership guidelines continue to align the interests of executives with shareholders  
 We continued a modest share buyback program to offset the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans  
 Executive pay practices are tied to robust risk and control features

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT     
Ford has a philosophy of direct, open, transparent and frequent engagement with our stakeholders,
including:

 Ford's senior leadership team and Investor Relations met with fixed income and equity holders, as well as potential holders, at eighteen
conferences and eighteen roadshows. We hosted quarterly earnings calls, which were webcast, and also engaged with the capital markets via phone calls, emails, in-house meetings, and other industry
events. We also held an autonomous vehicle event in Miami attended by key stakeholders. 
 As an indication of our commitment to fostering strong communication ties with our stakeholders, we met with shareholders representing 57% of
our institutional equity investor base and fixed income investors holding 25% of our unsecured debt outstanding. Topics discussed included: long term strategy, financial and operating performance,
risk management, and environmental, social and governance practices. We found these meetings to be informative, and we continue to incorporate many stakeholder suggestions into our Proxy Statement and
communications strategy. 



 
  



ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE

Corporate Governance


Corporate Governance Principles  

The
Nominating and Governance Committee developed and recommended to the Board a set of corporate governance principles, which the Board adopted. Ford's Corporate Governance Principles may be found on
its website at www.corporate.ford.com. These principles include: a limitation on the number of boards on which a director may serve, qualifications for directors
(including a requirement that directors be prepared to resign from the Board in the event of any significant 


change
in their personal circumstances that could affect the discharge of their responsibilities), director orientation and continuing education, and a requirement that the Board and each of its
Committees perform an annual self-evaluation. Shareholders may obtain a printed copy of the Company's Corporate Governance Principles by writing to our Shareholder Relations Department at Ford Motor
Company, Shareholder Relations, P.O. Box 6248, Dearborn, MI 48126. 




Our Governance Practices  



Ford
has a long history of operating under sound corporate governance practices, which is a critical element of creating profitable growth for all. These practices include the following: 















 
 Annual Election of All Directors.





 
 Majority Vote Standard. Each director must be elected by a majority of votes cast.





 
 Independent Board. 77% of the Director Nominees are independent.





 
 Lead Independent Director. Ensures management is adequately addressing the matters identified by the Board.





 
 Independent Board Committees. Each of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance committees is comprised entirely of independent directors.





 
 Committee Charters. Each standing committee operates under a written charter that has been approved by the Board and is reviewed annually.





 
 Independent Directors Meet Regularly Without Management and Non-Independent Directors.





 
 Regular Board and Committee Self-Evaluation Process. The Board and each committee evaluates its performance each year.




















 
 Mandatory Deferral of Compensation for Directors. In 2018, approximately 68% of annual director fees were mandatorily deferred into Ford restricted stock units, which strongly
links the interests of the Board with those of shareholders.





 
 Separate Chairman of the Board and CEO. The Board of Directors has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.





 
 Confidential Voting.





 
 Special Meetings. Shareholders have the right to call a special meeting.





 
 Shareholders May Take Action by Written Consent.





 
 Strong Codes of Ethics. Ford is committed to operating its business with the highest level of integrity and has adopted codes of ethics that apply to all directors and
senior financial personnel, and a code of conduct that applies to all employees.

Leadership Structure  




Ford
determines the most suitable leadership structure from time to time. At present, the Board of Directors has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. James P.
Hackett is our President and CEO, and William Clay Ford, Jr., is Chairman of the Board of Directors as well as our Executive Chairman. We believe this structure is optimal for Ford at this time
because it allows Mr. Hackett to focus on leading the organization while allowing Mr. Ford to focus on leading the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the Board has appointed Ellen R.
Marram as our Lead Independent Director. We believe having a Lead Independent Director is an important governance 


practice
given that the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Ford, is not an independent director under our Corporate Governance Principles. The duties of the Lead Independent Director
include:

 chairing the executive sessions of our independent directors; 
 advising on the selection of Board Committee Chairs; and 
 working with Mr. Ford and Mr. Hackett to ensure management is adequately addressing the matters identified by the Board. 
This
structure optimizes the roles of CEO, Chairman, and Lead Independent Director and provides Ford with sound corporate governance in the management of its business. 




Board Meetings, Composition, and Committees  








COMPOSITION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS / NOMINEES  
The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends the nominees for all directorships. The Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on
matters such as the size and composition of the Board in order to ensure the Board has the requisite expertise and its membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent
backgrounds. Between annual shareholder meetings, the Board may elect directors to the Board to serve until the next annual meeting. In 2018 we implemented a more robust peer and Board and Committee
self-assessment process. The Lead Independent Director communicates with each director concerning their performance and that of their peers and shares any significant concerns. We also instituted an
evaluation process whereby every five years each director's skills and qualifications are analyzed as to whether such skills and qualifications remain relevant in light of changing business
conditions. 
During
2018, the Committee recommended that the size of the Board be kept at 14. Ms. Marram is not standing for re-election this year having reached our mandatory retirement age. Consequently,
the Committee 


recommended
that the size of the Board be reduced to 13 at this time. 
The
Board believes that it has an appropriate mix of short- and medium-tenured directors as well as long-tenured directors that provide a balance that enables the Board to benefit from fresh insights
and historical perspectives during its deliberations. In addition, having two members of the Ford family, William Clay Ford, Jr. and Edsel B. Ford II, who are first cousins, bring
a unique historical and long-term perspective to Board deliberations. In addition, the Board has managed succession planning effectively with strategic waivers of the mandatory retirement age where
appropriate to maintain certain expertise while new directors supplement the Board structure. 
The
Board proposes to you a slate of nominees for election to the Board at the annual meeting. You may propose nominees (other than self-nominations) for consideration by the Committee by submitting
the names, qualifications, and other supporting information to: Secretary, Ford Motor Company, One American Road, Dearborn, MI 48126. Properly submitted recommendations must be received no later than
November 30, 2019, to be considered by the Committee for inclusion in the following year's nominations for election to the Board. Your properly submitted candidates are evaluated in the same
manner as those candidates recommended by other sources. All candidates are considered in light of the needs of the Board with due consideration given to the qualifications described on p. 24 under
Election of Directors.

EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS  
Non-employee directors ordinarily meet in executive session without management present at most regularly scheduled Board meetings and may meet at other times
at the discretion of the Lead Independent Director or at the request of any non-employee director. Additionally, all of the independent directors meet periodically (at least annually) without
management or non-independent directors present. 




BOARD COMMITTEES  
Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees, in accordance with the independence standards of the
New York Stock Exchange LLC ("NYSE") Listed Company and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and the Company's Corporate Governance Principles. Under these standards members of the
Audit Committee also satisfy the heightened SEC independence standards for audit committees and the members of the Compensation Committee satisfy the additional NYSE independence standards for
compensation committees. Each member of the Audit Committee also meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Listed Company rules. The Board, and each committee of the Board, has the
authority to engage independent consultants and advisors at the Company's expense. 
The
Company has published on its website (www.corporate.ford.com) the charter of each of the Audit, Compensation, Finance, Nominating and Governance, and Sustainability
and Innovation Committees of the Board. Printed copies of each of the committee charters are available by writing to our Shareholder Relations Department at Ford Motor Company, Shareholder Relations,
P.O. Box 6248, Dearborn, MI 48126.

Board's Role in Risk Management  




The
oversight responsibility of the Board and its Committees is supported by Company management and the risk management processes that are currently in place. Ford has extensive and effective risk
management processes, relating specifically to compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks. Compliance
Risk encompasses matters such as legal and regulatory compliance (e.g., Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, environmental, OSHA/safety, etc.).  Reporting Risk
covers Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, disclosure controls and procedures, and accounting compliance.
Operating Risk addresses the myriad of matters related to the operation of a complex company such as Ford
(e.g., quality, supply chain, sales and service, financing and liquidity, product development and engineering, labor, etc.). Strategic
Risk encompasses somewhat broader and longer-term matters, including, but not limited to, technology development, sustainability, capital allocation,
management development, retention and compensation, competitive developments, and geopolitical developments. 
We
believe that key success factors in the risk management at Ford include a strong risk analysis tone set by the Board and senior management, which is shown through their commitment to effective
top-down and bottom-up communication (including communication between management and the Board and Committees), and active cross-functional participation among the Business Units and Functional Skill
Teams. More specifically, we have institutionalized the Creating Value Roadmap Process, which includes a Business Plan Review and Special Attention Review process where, on a regular basis, the senior
leadership of the Company reviews the status of the business, the risks and opportunities presented to the business (in the areas of compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks), and,
utilizing the principles of design thinking and critical thinking, develops specific plans to address those risks and opportunities. 
The
Company has adopted a formal policy that requires the Creating Value Roadmap Process to be implemented by all Business Units and Functional Skill Teams. Our General Auditor's Office audits against
the policies and 


procedures
that have been adopted to support the Creating Value Roadmap Process. The Board of Directors recognizes the Creating Value Roadmap Process as the Company's primary risk management tool, and
the Audit Committee and the Board review annually the Creating Value Roadmap Process, the Company's adherence to it, and
its effectiveness. We continually review our enterprise risk management processes and procedures with the goal of improving our assessment of, and response to, risks and opportunities. 
As
noted above, the full Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of risk management at Ford and oversees operating risk management with reviews at each of its regular Board
meetings. The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific areas of risk management to certain committees of the Board, with each Board committee reporting to the full
Board following each committee meeting. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing compliance and reporting risk. The Board and the Audit and Compensation Committees periodically
review policies related to personnel matters, including those related to sexual harassment and anti-retaliation policies related to whistleblowers. The Board, the Sustainability and Innovation
Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Finance Committee all play a role in overseeing strategic risk management. 
The
scope and severity of risks presented by cyber threats have increased dramatically, and constant vigilance is required to protect against intrusions. We take cyber threats very seriously,
conducting alternating internal and external annual audits of our cyber security capabilities. These audits are a useful tool for ensuring that we maintain a robust cyber security program to protect
our investors, customers, employees, and intellectual property. The Audit Committee reviews our cyber security practices twice each year, with report outs to the Board as needed. 
We
also maintain an industry-leading cyber security insurance program with many of the world's largest and most respected insurance companies. Additionally, we are a founding member of the Board of
the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Our current seat on that Board ensures that we preserve relationships that help to protect ourselves against both enterprise and in-vehicle
security risks.

AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT AND AUDITOR ROTATION  
The Charter of the Audit Committee provides that a member of the Audit Committee generally may not serve on the audit committee of more than two other public
companies. The Board has designated Stephen G. Butler as an Audit Committee financial expert. Mr. Butler meets the independence standards for audit committee members under the NYSE Listed
Company and United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. The lead partner of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is rotated at least every five years. 




RISK ASSESSMENT REGARDING COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES  
In 2018, we conducted an annual assessment of our compensation policies and practices, including our executive compensation programs, to evaluate the
potential risks associated with these policies and practices. We reviewed and discussed the findings of the assessment with the Compensation Committee and concluded that our compensation programs are
designed with an appropriate balance of risk and reward and do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking behavior. As a result, we do not believe that risks relating to our compensation
policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
In
conducting this review, we considered the following attributes of our programs:

 mix of base salary, annual bonus opportunities, and long-term equity compensation, with performance-based equity compensation opportunities for
officers; 
 alignment of annual and long-term incentives to ensure that the awards encourage consistent behaviors and incentivize performance results;  
 inclusion of non-financial metrics, such as quality, and other quantitative and qualitative performance factors in determining actual
compensation payouts; 



 capped payout levels for both the Incentive Bonus Plan and performance-based stock awards for Named Executives  the
Compensation Committee has negative discretion over incentive program payouts; 
 use of Time-Based Units that vest ratably over three years and Performance Units that have a three-year performance period with performance
measured against internal financial metrics (75% weighting) and relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") (25% weighting); 
 generally providing senior executives with long-term equity-based compensation on an annual basis  we believe that
accumulating equity over a period of time encourages executives to take actions that promote the long-term sustainability of our business; 
 double-trigger change-in-control provisions for equity grants awarded in and after 2016; and 
 stock ownership goals that align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders  this discourages
executive officers from focusing on short-term results without regard to longer-term consequences. 
 Recoupment Policy. The Committee formally adopted a policy of recoupment of compensation in certain
circumstances. The purpose of this policy is to help ensure executives act in the best interests of the Company. The policy requires any Company officer to repay or return cash bonuses and equity
awards in the event: (i) the Company issues a material restatement of its financial statements, and the restatement was caused by such officer's intentional misconduct; (ii) such officer
was found to be in violation of non-compete provisions of any plan or agreement; or (iii) such officer has committed ethical or criminal violations. The Committee will consider all relevant
factors and exercise business judgment in determining any appropriate amounts to recoup up to 100% of any awards.

of our executive compensation programs with the goal of appropriately balancing short-term incentives and long-term performance. 




COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OPERATIONS  
The Compensation Committee establishes and reviews our executive compensation philosophy and strategy and oversees our various executive compensation
programs. The Committee is responsible for evaluating the performance of and determining the compensation for our Executive Chairman, the President and CEO, and other executive officers and approving
the compensation structure for senior management, including officers. The Committee is comprised of four directors who are considered independent under the NYSE Listed Company rules and our Corporate
Governance Principles. The Committee's membership is determined by our Board of Directors. The Committee operates under a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors. The Committee annually
reviews the charter. A copy of the charter may be found on our website at www.corporate.ford.com. 
The
Committee makes decisions regarding the compensation of our officers that are Vice Presidents and above, including the Named Executives. The Committee has delegated authority, within prescribed
share limits, to a Long-Term Incentive Compensation Award Committee (comprised of William Clay Ford, Jr., and James P. Hackett) to approve grants of options, Performance Units, Time-Based Units, and
other stock-based awards, and to the Annual Incentive Compensation Award Committee (also comprised of Messrs. Ford and Hackett) to determine bonuses for other employees. 
The
Board of Directors makes decisions relating to non-employee director compensation. Any proposed changes are reviewed in advance and recommended to the Board by the Nominating and Governance
Committee (see Director Compensation in 2018 on pp. 32-33). 
The
Compensation Committee considers recommendations from Mr. Ford, Mr. Hackett, and the Chief Human Resources Officer in developing compensation plans and evaluating performance of
other executive officers. The Committee's consultant also provides advice and analysis on the structure and level of executive compensation. Final decisions on any major element of compensation,
however, as well as total compensation for executive officers, are made by the Compensation Committee. 
As
in prior years, in 2018 the Committee engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC, an independent 


compensation
consulting firm, to advise the Committee on executive compensation and benefits matters. Semler Brossy is retained directly by the Committee, which has the sole authority to review and
approve the budget of the independent consultant. Semler Brossy does not advise our management and receives no other compensation from us. The same Semler Brossy principal attended all eight of the
Committee meetings in 2018. 
The
Committee has analyzed whether the work of Semler Brossy as a compensation consultant has raised any conflict of interest, taking into consideration the following factors: (i) the provision
of any other services to the Company by Semler Brossy; (ii) the amount of fees the Company paid to Semler Brossy as a percentage of the firm's total revenue; (iii) Semler Brossy's
policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of Semler Brossy or the individual compensation advisor employed by the
firm with an executive officer of the Company; (v) any business or personal relationship of the individual compensation advisor with any member of the Committee; and (vi) any stock of
the Company owned by Semler Brossy or the individual compensation advisor employed by the firm. The Committee has determined, based on its analysis of the above factors, that the work of Semler Brossy
and the individual compensation advisor employed by Semler Brossy as compensation consultant to the Committee has not created any conflict of interest. 
In
addition, the Committee reviewed survey data provided by the Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database (see Competitive Survey on pp. 43-44). Willis Towers Watson does not make
recommendations to, nor does it assist, the Committee in determining compensation of executive officers. Willis Towers Watson is retained by Ford management, not the Committee. 
Committee
meetings typically occur prior to the meetings of the full Board of Directors. Incentive Bonus targets and awards, Performance Unit grants, Time-Based Units, and cash awards typically are
decided at the February or March Committee meeting (see Timing of Awards on pp. 46-47). Officer salaries are reviewed in February each year. 
See
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pp. 38-59 for more detail on the factors considered by the Committee in making executive compensation decisions.

The Committee reviews our talent and executive development program with senior management. These reviews are conducted periodically and focus on executive development and
succession planning throughout the organization, at the Vice President level and above. 


Our
policy, approved by the Compensation Committee, to limit outside board participation by our officers, is:

 no more than 15% of all officers should be on unaffiliated for-profit boards at any given point in time; and  
 no officer should be a member of more than one unaffiliated for-profit board. 



 




Independence of Directors and Relevant Facts and Circumstances  


 








DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE  
A majority of the directors must be independent directors under applicable SEC and NYSE Listed Company rules. These rules provide that no director can qualify
as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company. The Board has adopted the following standards in determining whether or
not a director has a material relationship with the Company. These standards are contained in Ford's Corporate Governance Principles and may be found at the Company's website,
www.corporate.ford.com.  

Employee or Former Employee.  No
director who is an employee or a former employee of the Company can be independent until three years after termination of such employment.   
Independent Auditor Affiliation.  No
director who is, or in the past three years has been, affiliated with or employed by the Company's present or former independent auditor can be independent until three years after the end of the
affiliation, employment, or auditing relationship.   
Interlocking Directorship.  No director
can be independent if he or she is, or in the past three years has been, part of an interlocking directorship in which an executive officer of the Company serves on the compensation committee of
another company that employs the director.   
Additional Compensation.  No director
can be independent if he or she is receiving, or in the last three years has received, more than $100,000 during any 12-month period in direct compensation from the Company, other than director and
committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation 



for
prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). 


Immediate Family Members.  Directors
with immediate family members in the foregoing categories are subject to the same three-year restriction. 
Other Relationships.  The following commercial, charitable, and educational relationships will not be
considered to be material relationships that would impair a director's independence: 


(i)Sales and Purchases of Products/Services. If within the preceding three years a Ford director was an executive
officer or employee of another company (or an immediate family member of the director was an executive officer of such company) that did business with Ford and either: (a) the annual sales to
Ford were less than the greater of $1 million or two percent of the total annual revenues of such company, or (b) the annual purchases from Ford were less than the greater of
$1 million or two percent of the total annual revenues of Ford, in each case for any of the three most recently completed fiscal years.
(ii)Indebtedness. If within the preceding three years a Ford director was an executive officer of another company which
was indebted to Ford, or to which Ford was indebted, and either: (a) the total amount of such other company's indebtedness to Ford was less than two percent of the total consolidated assets of
Ford, or (b) the total amount of Ford's indebtedness to such other company was less than two percent of the total consolidated assets of such other company, in each case for any of the three
most recently completed fiscal years.
(iii)Charitable Contributions. If within the preceding three years a Ford director served as an executive officer,
director, or trustee of a charitable or educational organization, and

Ford's
discretionary contributions to the organization were less than the greater of $1 million or two percent of that organization's total annual
discretionary receipts for any of the three most recently completed fiscal years. (Any matching of charitable contributions will not be included in the amount of Ford's contributions for this
purpose.) 

Based
on these independence standards and all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Board determined that none of the following directors had any material relationship with the Company and,
thus, are independent: Stephen G. Butler, Kimberly A. Casiano, Anthony F. Earley, Jr., William W. Helman IV, William E. Kennard, John C. Lechleiter, Ellen R. Marram, John L. Thornton, John B.
Veihmeyer, Lynn M. Vojvodich, and John S. Weinberg. Additionally, the Board has determined that each of Stephen G. Butler, Kimberly A. Casiano, John B. Veihmeyer, and Lynn M. Vojvodich is independent
under the heightened SEC independence standards for audit committees and that each of Anthony F. Earley, Jr., John C. Lechleiter, Ellen R. Marram, and John L. Thornton is independent under the
additional NYSE independence standards for compensation committees. 






DISCLOSURE OF RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  
With respect to the independent directors listed above, the Board considered the following relevant facts and circumstances in making the independence
determinations: 
From
time to time during the past three years, Ford purchased goods and services from, sold goods and services to, or financing arrangements were provided by, various companies with which certain
directors were or are affiliated either as a member of such company's board of directors or, in the case of Messrs. Earley and Weinberg, as an officer of such a company. In addition to
Messrs. Earley and Weinberg, these directors included Mr. Kennard, Ms. Marram, Mr. Thornton, Ms. Vojvodich, and Mr. Veihmeyer. The Company also made donations
to certain institutions with which certain directors are affiliated. These included Ms. Casiano, Mr. Earley, Dr. Lechleiter, Ms. Marram, Mr. Thornton, and
Mr. Veihmeyer. In addition, the Company made charitable donations in each director's name in lieu of holiday gifts. None of the relationships described above was material under the independence
standards contained in our Corporate Governance Principles. 




Codes of Ethics  




The
Company has published on its website (www.corporate.ford.com) its code of conduct handbook, which applies to all officers and employees, a code of ethics for
directors, and a code of ethics for the Company's chief executive officer as well as senior financial and accounting personnel. Any waiver of, or amendments to, the codes of ethics for directors or 


executive
officers, including the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and the principal accounting officer, must be approved by the Nominating and Governance Committee, and any such
waivers or amendments will be disclosed promptly by the Company by posting such waivers or amendments to its website. The Nominating and Governance Committee also reviews management's monitoring of
compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct. Printed copies of each of the codes of ethics referred to above are also available by writing to our Investor Relations Department at Ford Motor Company,
Investor Relations, P.O. Box 6248, Dearborn, MI 48126.

Board has established a process by which you may send communications to the Board as a whole, the non-employee Directors as a group, or the Lead Independent Director. You may send communications

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  
Based on Company records and other information, Ford believes that all SEC filing requirements applicable to its directors and executive
officers were complied with for 2018 and prior years. 


Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  








POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
Business transactions between Ford and its officers or directors, including companies in which a director or officer (or an immediate family member) has a
substantial ownership interest or a company where such director or officer (or an immediate family member) serves as an executive officer ("related party transactions") are not prohibited. In fact,
certain related party transactions can be beneficial to the Company and its shareholders. 
It
is important, however, to ensure that any related party transactions are beneficial to the Company. Accordingly, any related party transaction, regardless of amount, is submitted to the Nominating
and Governance Committee in advance for review and approval. All existing related party transactions are reviewed at least annually by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Office of the
General Counsel reviews all such related party transactions, existing or proposed, prior to submission to the Nominating and Governance Committee, and our General Counsel opines on the appropriateness
of each related party transaction. The Nominating and Governance Committee may, at its discretion, consult with outside legal counsel. 
Any
director or officer with an interest in a related party transaction is expected to recuse himself or herself from any consideration of the matter. 
The
Nominating and Governance Committee's approval of a related party transaction may encompass a series of subsequent transactions contemplated by the original approval, i.e., transactions
contemplated by an ongoing business relationship occurring over a period of time. Examples include transactions in the normal course of business between the Company and a dealership owned by a
director or an executive officer (or an immediate 


family member thereof), transactions in the normal course of business between the Company and financial institutions with which a director or officer may be
associated, and the ongoing issuances of purchase orders or releases against a blanket purchase order made in the normal course of business by the Company to a business with which a director or
officer may be associated. In such instances, any such approval shall require that the Company make all decisions with respect to such ongoing business relationship in accordance with existing
policies and procedures applicable to non-related party transactions (e.g., Company purchasing policies governing awards of business to suppliers, etc.). 
In
all cases, a director or officer with an interest in a related party transaction may not attempt to influence Company personnel in making any decision with respect to the transaction. 




RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
In February 2002, Ford entered into a Stadium Naming and License Agreement with The Detroit Lions, Inc. (the "Lions"), pursuant to which we acquired
for $50 million, paid by us in 2002, the naming rights to a new domed stadium located in downtown Detroit at which the Lions began playing their home games during the 2002 National Football
League season. We named the stadium "Ford Field." The term of the naming rights agreement is 25 years, which commenced with the 2002 National Football League season. Benefits to Ford under the
naming rights agreement include exclusive exterior entrance signage and predominant interior promotional signage.
Beginning in 2005, the Company also agreed to provide to the Lions, at no cost, eight new model year Ford, Lincoln or Mercury brand vehicles manufactured by Ford in North America for use by the
management and staff of Ford Field and the Lions and to replace such vehicles in each second successive year, for the remainder of the naming rights agreement. The cost incurred during 2018 was
$63,509. William Clay Ford, Jr., is a minority owner and is a director and officer of the Lions.

Proposal 1. Election of Directors





IDENTIFICATION OF DIRECTORS  
The Charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee provides that the Committee conducts all necessary and appropriate inquiries into the background and
qualifications of possible candidates as directors. The Committee identifies candidates through a variety of means, including search firms, recommendations from members of the Committee and the Board,
including the Executive Chairman and the President and CEO, and suggestions from Company management. The Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any search firm to be used to assist
it in identifying and evaluating candidates to serve as directors of the Company. The Company on behalf of the Committee has paid fees to third-party firms to assist the Committee in the
identification and evaluation of potential Board members. 
Thirteen
directors will be elected at this year's annual meeting. Each director will serve until the next annual meeting or until he or she is succeeded by another qualified director who has been
elected. Ms. Marram, having reached our mandatory retirement age of 72, will not stand for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
We
will vote your shares as you specify when providing your proxy. If you do not specify how you want your shares voted when you provide your proxy, we will vote them for the
election of all of the nominees listed below. If unforeseen circumstances (such as death or disability) make it necessary for the Board of Directors to substitute another
person for any of the nominees, we will vote your shares for that other person. 






QUALIFICATIONS CONSIDERED FOR NOMINEES  
Because Ford is a large and complex company, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers numerous qualifications when considering candidates for the
Board. In addition to the qualifications listed below, among the most important qualities directors should possess are the highest personal and professional ethical standards, integrity, and values.
They should be committed to representing the long-term interests of all shareholders. Directors must also have practical wisdom and mature judgment. Directors must be objective and inquisitive. Ford
recognizes the value of diversity, and we endeavor to have a diverse Board, with experience in business, international operations, finance, manufacturing and product development, marketing and sales,
government, education, technology, and in areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities. The biographies of the nominees show that, taken as a whole, the current slate of director
nominees possesses these qualifications. Directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to carrying out their duties and responsibilities effectively, including making themselves available for
consultation outside of regularly scheduled Board meetings, and should be committed to serve on the Board for an extended period of time. Directors should also be prepared to offer their resignation
in the event of any significant change in their personal circumstances that could affect the discharge of their responsibilities as directors of the Company, including a change in their principal job
responsibilities. 
Each
of the nominees for director is now a member of the Board of Directors, which met nine times during 2018. Each of the nominees for director attended at least 75% of the combined Board and
committee meetings held during the periods served by such nominee in 2018. The nominees provided the following information about themselves as of the latest practical date. Additionally, for each
director nominee we have disclosed the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills that led the Board to conclude that the nominee supports the Company's strategy and thus, should
serve as a director.

1Fees.    Effective as of January 1, 2017, the Board of Directors agreed that the
following compensation will be paid to non-employee directors of the Company: 














 Annual Board membership fee
 


$
315,000
 


 Annual Lead Independent Director fee
 


$
50,000
 


 Annual Audit Committee chair fee
 


$

 Annual Compensation Committee chair fee
 


$
25,000
 


 Annual other Committee chair fees
 


$
20,000
 






In
2016, a review of director compensation at companies similarly situated to Ford indicated that Ford was below the median levels paid to directors. The
increases are consistent with Ford's philosophy of paying its directors near the top level of the leading companies in order to permit the Company to continue to attract quality directors. The entire
increase in the Annual Board membership fee is mandatorily deferred into restricted stock units pursuant to the 2014 Plan.
As
discussed in footnote 2 below, certain directors chose to receive all or a portion of their fees in restricted stock units pursuant to the 2014 Plan
in addition to the mandatory portion. Pursuant to SEC rules, the dollar value of any fees any director elected to receive in restricted units in excess of the fees mandatorily paid in restricted stock
units pursuant to that plan is shown in the "Fees Earned or Paid in Cash" column.
22014 Plan. Effective January 1, 2014, the Board adopted the 2014 Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors of Ford Motor Company. The 2014 Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual Meeting. The 2014 Plan is structured so that approximately 68% (the "mandatory portion") of the Annual
Board membership fee is mandatorily paid in Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). The amounts shown in column (c) are the grant date values of the RSUs relating to the mandatory portion of fees paid
under the 2014 Plan. Each Director also had the option of having some or all of his or her remaining fees paid in RSUs pursuant to the 2014 Plan. The RSUs vest immediately upon grant. Each Director
had the option to choose when the RSUs settle into shares of Ford common stock as follows: (i) immediately on the grant date; (ii) the earlier of five years from the date of grant and
separation from the Board; or (iii) at separation from the Board. The Board adopted the 2014 Plan because the RSUs settle in shares of common stock, thus further aligning the interests of
directors and shareholders. Directors are not permitted to sell, hedge, or pledge the mandatory portion of the Annual Board fees until after separation from the Board, even if the RSUs settle into
shares of common stock prior to separation from the Board. In light of the requirement that approximately 68% of annual director fees are paid in RSUs, and that directors may not dispose of such RSUs
or shares of stock until after separation from the Board, there is no minimum share ownership requirement for members of the Board. If dividends are paid on common stock, Dividend Equivalents are paid
in additional RSUs on RSU balances for those directors whose RSUs have not settled into shares of common stock. For any directors whose RSUs have settled into shares of common stock, they are required
to reinvest those dividends into additional shares of common stock until separation from the Board.
3The
amount shown for Edsel B. Ford II reflects the fees he earned pursuant to a January 1999 consulting agreement between the Company and
Mr. Ford. The consulting fee is payable quarterly in arrears in cash. Mr. Ford is available for consultation, representation, and other duties under the agreement. Additionally, the
Company provides facilities (including office space) and an administrative assistant to Mr. Ford. This agreement will continue until either party ends it with 30 days' notice.
4Perquisites and Evaluation Vehicle Program. All amounts shown in this column reflect: (i) the cost
of evaluation vehicles provided to Directors; (ii) the cost of a charitable gift made by the Company in the directors' names divided equally among those directors who were active at
December 31, 2018, and (iii) the cost of healthcare insurance premiums for certain directors. We calculate the aggregate incremental costs of providing the evaluation vehicles by
estimating the lease fee of a comparable vehicle under our Management Lease Program. The lease fee under that program takes into account the cost of using the vehicle, maintenance, license, title and
registration fees,

and
insurance. We provide non-employee directors with the use of up to two Company vehicles free of charge. Directors are expected to provide evaluations of the vehicles to the Company. The cost of
providing these vehicles is included in column (d).  


5Insurance. Ford provides non-employee directors with $200,000 of life insurance which ends when a director
retires. A director can choose to reduce life insurance coverage to $50,000 and lower income imputation. Effective January 1, 2014, the non-employee director life insurance program was changed
to allow former employees who become directors to participate in the program and keep the life insurance coverage provided to retired employees. The life insurance premiums paid by the Company for
each director are included in column (d). Ford also provides non-employee directors with the option to obtain Company provided healthcare insurance at no cost. The healthcare insurance is identical to
healthcare insurance provided to employees, except for the employee paid portion of premiums. Eight directors have elected this option and that portion of the premiums that the Company pays on behalf
of directors that equals the amount employees typically pay is included in column (d).

The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors selects and hires the independent registered public accounting firm. You must ratify the Audit Committee's selection for 2019. 
The
Audit Committee selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") to perform an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers is well qualified to serve as our independent registered
public accounting firm. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement and answer appropriate questions. 


Amounts
paid by the Company to PricewaterhouseCoopers for audit and non-audit services rendered in 2018 and 2017 are disclosed in the table below. 
Ford
management will present the following resolution to the meeting: 
"RESOLVED, That the selection, by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered
public accounting firm to perform an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the

Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     

Annually,
the Audit Committee pre-approves categories of services to be performed (rather than individual engagements) by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As part of this approval, an amount is established for
each category of services (Audit, Audit-Related, Tax Services, and other services). In the event the pre-approved amounts prove to be insufficient, a request for incremental funding will be submitted
to the Audit 


Committee
for approval during the next regularly scheduled meeting. In addition, all new engagements greater than $250,000 will be presented in advance to the Audit Committee for approval. A regular
report is prepared for each regular Audit Committee meeting outlining actual fees and expenses paid or committed against approved fees. The Audit Committee approved of all of the fees listed in the
table below.

Audit Committee Report  




The
Audit Committee is composed of four directors, all of whom meet the independence standards contained in the NYSE Listed Company rules, SEC rules, and Ford's Corporate Governance Principles, and
operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter may be found on the Company's website, www.corporate.ford.com.
The Audit Committee selects, subject to shareholder ratification, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Ford
management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, is responsible for
performing independent audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial
statements with United States generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors the Company's
financial reporting process and reports to the Board of Directors on its findings. PricewaterhouseCoopers has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 1946. 




AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE  
During the last year, the Audit Committee met and held discussions with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with
Ford management and PricewaterhouseCoopers the audited financial statements and the assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting contained in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the 


year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the matters required to be discussed by applicable
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee, as well as by SEC regulations. In
conjunction with the mandated rotation of PricewaterhouseCoopers's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairperson are also directly involved in the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers's new lead engagement partner. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers
submitted to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the
independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers such firm's independence. In
order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC. 
The
Audit Committee also considered whether the provision of other non-audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers to the Company is compatible with maintaining the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers
and concluded that the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers is not compromised by the provision of such services.

 Proposal 3. Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executives

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide you with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the
compensation of our Named Executives, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. At the 2017 Annual Meeting you approved our proposal to
provide you with this opportunity on an annual basis. 
As
described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we seek to closely align the interests of our Named Executives with yours. Our compensation programs are designed to reward our
Named Executives for the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic and operational goals, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. We urge you to read the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pp. 38-59 and the other related executive compensation disclosures so that you have an 


understanding
of our executive compensation philosophy, policies, and practices. 
The
vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather the vote relates to the compensation of our Named Executives, as described in this Proxy Statement.
The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee. 
Ford
management will present the following resolution to the meeting: 
"RESOLVED, That the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executives, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy
Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and
the other related tables and disclosure."

2018  LAYING THE FOUNDATION  
Over the past year, we have steadily laid the foundation for the global redesign of our business. 2018 was a year in which we made many important strategic
choices and began to take actions that will fundamentally redesign our business and ensure we are fit and more resilient to compete for years to come. Fitness is not merely a cost-cutting exercise,
but a renewed emphasis on reducing complexity throughout the organization in order to speed up decision-making and become more efficient. It also means developing the capabilities that allow us to
compete and win. Winning will be measured 


by
Company Revenue, Company Adjusted EBIT Margin, Company Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Return On Invested Capital, and ultimately achieving superior Total Shareholder Returns ("TSR") among our peer
group. We started our transition in 2017, and in 2018 we set the foundation for our future of becoming the world's most trusted company, designing smart vehicles for a smart world. The graphic below
shows our operational performance over the past several years. We have built a solid foundation on which to launch our strategic choices for the future.

Our
2018 Company Revenue was higher than 2017. Net income was $3.7 billion and Company adjusted EBIT was $7.0 billion. Company Adjusted EBIT Margin was 4.4%. Company adjusted operating
cash flow was positive $2.8 billion. From our perspective, results were disappointing with all key metrics down from the prior year other than Company Revenue. The NEO Compensation section of
the CD&A (pp. 48-58), reflects our performance against metrics over the 2018 performance period for the Incentive Bonus Plan and the 2016-2018 performance period for the 2016 Performance Unit grant. 






IMPROVING OUR FITNESS TO FINANCE OUR GROWTH  
The information in this Performance Section shows we continue to deliver positive results over a sustained time period. In order to create greater value for
our stakeholders, it is important that we attack costs as well as redesign our business operations to take advantage of future growth opportunities. The following graphics show some of our
achievements in these areas and the strategic choices we are making to drive future growth.

FORD TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN ("TSR") PERFORMANCE  

Achieving superior shareholder returns is what the employees of Ford strive for each day, and we realize that our TSR has lagged that of our peer group and the
S&P 500 over the most recently completed one-, three-, and five-year periods. Our efforts to become more fit and to strengthen those areas of our business where we are
winning  primarily through the Creating Tomorrow, Together strategy (see p. 38)  is expected to provide the profits necessary
to invest in the future of winning propulsion choices, autonomous technologies, and mobility experiences. We will continue to implement this strategy with a passion for product and keen focus on
customer insights that will differentiate us from our competition and position us to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. 
Our
operating performance affects our TSR and we tie operating performance to our incentive plan payouts. Our Performance Unit grants include internal financial metrics and relative TSR as factors.
Thus, payouts under the 2016 Performance Unit grant, which occurred in March 2019, reflect actual relative TSR performance against our peer group as constituted in 2016. This links our executives'
performance to shareholder interests, which is a key tenet of our pay-for-performance philosophy (see 2016 Performance Unit Results on p. 55-56 for a discussion of the 2016 Performance Unit
payout). 
As
the graphic on p. 39 shows, our operating results remained positive in 2018 with increased revenue, positive 


earnings
per share and Company Adjusted Operating Cash Flow. Shareholders have benefited from our results. Since reinstituting dividends in 2012, we have returned $18.4 billion to shareholders
through year-end 2018 through dividends and share buybacks. We maintained our regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share throughout 2018 and paid a supplemental dividend of $0.13 per share in the
first quarter. In the first quarter of 2019, we maintained the $0.15 per share regular dividend. 
For
2019, we see the potential for year-over-year improvement across all key metrics, including Company Revenue, Company Adjusted EBIT Margin, and Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). We also
acknowledge certain external influences could affect our 2019 results, including tariffs, commodity costs, and interest rates, among other events.* 
Looking
ahead, 2019 is about implementation. A year where our thinking about the future of Ford  the fundamental redesign of the business, our capital allocation choices, our
fitness, our alliance choices  become increasingly clear. Our capital allocation priorities include funding our traditional product and non-product investment plans, our growth
plans for electrification, autonomy and mobility, and shareholder distributions. We believe focusing on these priorities will create value for all of our stakeholders.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY  



Our
Global Compensation and Benefits Philosophy, Strategy, and Guiding Principles are the pillars that provide the foundation upon which compensation and benefits programs are developed at Ford. The
Guiding Principles ensure our Philosophy and Strategy statements are applied consistently across the business for our salaried employees. Driving total shareholder return is inherent in each pillar.
They work together  no one principle is more important than any other, and business judgment is used to balance them to ensure our compensation and benefit programs are effective
in supporting our strategy. 
The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors regularly reviews the Global Philosophy, Strategy, and Guiding Principles and, in connection with its review of our gender pay equity practices
during 2018, determined to include a statement on gender pay equity. In addition, the Committee updated the language to reflect our overall strategic direction. These changes reinforce that pay equity
is an important objective that will attract top talent to Ford, and reinforces that compensation practices are tied to our strategy. The changes the Committee approved are highlighted in blue below. 
Global Compensation and Benefits Philosophy: Ford Motor Company was built on the belief that freedom of
movement drives human progress. It is a belief that has always fueled our passion to create great cars and trucks. And today, it drives our commitment to become the world's most trusted company,
designing smart vehicles for a smart world that help people move more safely, confidently and freely. We cannot compete for the future we envision unless we are fit in all aspects of our
business.
Attracting, retaining, and developing amazing talent that is empowered to work together to compete and win is a fundamental aspect of our fitness. A core principle of our talent
management strategy is a longstanding 


commitment to equal opportunity in all aspects of employment, including the way Ford compensates its employees.
Compensation
and benefits programs are an important part of the Company's employment relationship, which also includes challenging and rewarding work, growth and career development opportunities, and
being part of a leading company with a diverse workforce and great products. Ford strives to have these features as part of its compensation and
benefits:


 A consistent framework that is affordable to the business. 
 A pay for performance focus  individuals are rewarded for performance and contributions to business success.  
Compensation is fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar personal
characteristics.
 A total package that will be competitive with leading companies. 

Global Compensation and Benefits Strategy: Compensation will be used to attract, retain, and motivate employees and to reward
the achievement of business results through the delivery of competitive pay and incentive programs. Benefits provide employees with income security and protection from catastrophic loss. The Company
will develop affordable, competitive benefit programs that meet these objectives. 




GUIDING PRINCIPLES  

Pay Equity.Ford employee compensation in
each market should be fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar personal characteristics. This applies to all forms of pay, including base salary, incentives, bonuses, and other
forms of compensation.
Performance Orientation. Compensation programs should
support and reinforce a pay-for-performance culture. They should motivate and reward employees for achieving desired business results. Benefit programs should provide income security and
support/protect for catastrophic loss.

Competitive Positioning. Competitive compensation and
benefit programs are critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining a high performing workforce. We target the average competitive level of automotive and other leading companies within the
national market, including large automotive, leading multinational, and other selected companies, as appropriate. Competitiveness will be measured based on program value to employees relative to the
comparator group. When business conditions are such that our incentive programs do not provide competitive compensation on a longer-term basis, we will use short-and long-term retention programs to
ensure the Company retains key employees who enable the Company to respond successfully to financial and operational challenges. 
Affordability. Compensation and benefits must be affordable
to the Company over the medium- to long-term. To the extent possible, compensation and benefit programs will not fluctuate significantly based on short-term business conditions.  
Desired Behaviors. Compensation and benefit programs should
support the Company's business performance objectives and promote desired behaviors. 
Flexibility. Compensation, benefit, and other related
programs should take into account workforce diversity and provide meaningful individual choice where appropriate. 
Consistency and Stability. It is a Company objective to
provide consistent and stable programs globally (subject to legal, competitive, and cultural constraints), particularly for higher level positions. Compensation and benefit programs should have a high
degree of consistency within countries (i.e., among various pay levels and employee groups) and should not fluctuate significantly year-over-year. Programs may vary when competitively driven.  
Delivery Efficiency. Compensation, benefit, and other
related programs should be understandable and easy to administer while leveraging economies of scale and technology. They should be implemented in a consistent, equitable, and efficient manner.
Programs will be delivered in a manner that is tax-effective to the Company and employees as far as practicable. 
Delivery Effectiveness. Clearly defined metrics should be
developed for compensation, benefit, and other related programs that are aligned with corporate business performance metrics. Metrics are designed and utilized to measure and continually improve
business results. 


In
keeping with the above, our total direct compensation for Named Executives, consisting of base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity incentive, is heavily weighted towards
performance. Base salary represents 20% or less of each Named Executive's target opportunity, and a majority of our executives' target compensation is contingent on meeting incentive plan metrics. 




PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS  







MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS  
The Committee considered recommendations from the Executive Chairman, the President and CEO, and the Chief Human Resources Officer, in developing compensation
plans and evaluating performance of executive officers. The Committee's independent consultant also provides advice and analyses on the structure and level of executive compensation (see Compensation
Committee Operations on pp. 16-17). Our senior leadership team established our corporate priorities and developed the 2018 business plan metrics, which were approved at the December 2017 Board
meeting. Our Human Resources and Finance departments developed the incentive plan performance weightings, targets, and payout ranges in support of the business plan and in December 2017 presented the
recommendations to the Committee. Final decisions on the design of our incentive plans and all major elements of compensation, however, as well as total compensation for each executive officer, were
made by the Compensation Committee at the February and March 2018 meetings. 
We
tie our executive compensation to performance against defined metrics aligned with our strategic objectives. The metrics used in our Incentive Bonus Plan and Performance Unit grants have undergone
changes over the years to support our business strategies. As we continue to address core business performance in response to the evolving business environment, and invest in a future that is
increasingly driven by automation, electrification and mobility services, the Committee has continually reviewed the metrics used in our performance-based plans and adopted metrics consistent with our
strategies on efficiency (margin), balance sheet strength and shareholder

With
those priorities in mind, the Committee adopted metrics and weightings shown in the following table for the 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan and Performance Unit grants. 



Please
refer to 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan Results on pp. 51-52 for details on our performance against metrics and payouts under our Incentive Bonus Plan for 2018. Also, refer to 2016
Performance Unit Results on pp. 55-56 for details on our performance against metrics and payouts for the 2016-2018 performance period. 




COMPETITIVE SURVEY  
 December 2017 Survey.    In December 2017, the Committee reviewed a report analyzing Ford's compensation programs for executives compared to our peer group companies.
The Committee used the December 2017 Survey as an input for setting 2018 executive compensation. The report was prepared by the Company and reviewed by the Committee's independent consultant, and was
based on information obtained from the Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database. The report discussed how our executive compensation program compared with those of peer companies on base
salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, and total direct compensation. The 


survey
group compensation data was collected during the second quarter of 2017 and, therefore, reflected any bonuses paid in early 2017 for 2016 performance, as well as equity grants made in early
2017. 
While
the Committee used the December 2017 Survey data as a reference point, it was not the sole determining factor in executive compensation decisions in 2018. We generally seek to target total
compensation opportunities at or around the survey group's median total compensation. Consistent with our compensation Guiding Principles, we incorporate flexibility into our compensation programs to
respond to, and adjust for, changes in the business/economic environment and individual accomplishments, performance, and circumstances. 
 December 2018 Survey.    The December 2018 Survey is used throughout the CD&A when we discuss the competitiveness of the elements of the Named Executives' targeted
compensation compared to our survey group. This survey was reviewed in December 2018, and includes 2018 compensation data of the survey group. The December 2018 Survey was prepared by the Company and
reviewed by the Committee's consultant, and based on the Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database. 
The
Committee uses the following criteria to determine the companies included in the survey group:


 member of the Fortune 100; 
 similar primary business to Ford and/or similar business model (e.g., engineering, manufacturing, sales, financial services, and
numerous job matches); 
 particular line of business comprises no more than 20% of the total peer group; and 
 participates in the Willis Towers Watson survey process. 

The
above criteria ensure that the chosen executive compensation survey group will be representative of Ford's market for talent. The Committee reviews the criteria and survey group annually, and for
the December 2017 Survey added Microsoft and Intel to represent the high-tech sector in which Ford increasingly competes for talent. Changes to the survey group are typically minimized in order to
support year-over-year data stability and reliability. Our non-U.S. based competitors do not participate in the Willis Towers Watson survey process. The survey group shown below

The
December 2018 Survey group used throughout the CD&A for comparison purposes is the same as group listed above, except that Arconic was excluded and Verizon was added. Arconic no longer met our
criteria as a large company once it was spun-off from Alcoa. Verizon met most of the criteria to be included in the peer group. The survey database did not contain enough job-position-related matches
for Mr. Ford, our Executive Chairman, and Mr. Hinrichs, President, Global Operations. Consequently, their compensation was excluded from our analysis of how the total direct compensation
of our Named Executives compares to that of the survey group. The December 2018 Survey results indicated that the targeted total direct compensation for Mr. Hackett was at the survey group's
median. Targeted total direct compensation was above the survey group's median for Mr. Farley, while at the median for Mr. Shanks. An analysis of how each element of compensation
compared to the survey data for 2018, as well as how the factors described above affected Named Executive compensation decisions during 2018, is included in the discussion of each compensation
element. 




INTERNAL PAY EQUITY  WEALTH ANALYSIS  
Periodically, the Committee reviews the amount of all components of compensation of our executive officers. This review includes data on salary, annual
bonuses, and equity-based awards, as well as qualitative and quantitative data on perquisites. The Committee also takes into account relative pay considerations within the officer group and data
covering individual performance. The Committee uses this analysis to assist it in ensuring internal equity among the officer group. 
The
Committee also considers the potential value of outstanding equity grants and uses this information as one data-point in evaluating equity compensation grants. For instance, the Committee
regularly reviews 


the
value of equity-based awards at certain price levels of Ford stock. The analysis includes the following:


 "in-the-money" stock options; 
 unvested Restricted Stock Units; and 
 outstanding Performance Unit grants. 

The
Committee uses this analysis to evaluate the accumulated wealth and retention value in equity of the Named Executives in light of the Company's change in market value. The Committee believes that
our equity-based incentive
programs are effective in attracting, motivating, and retaining executives, as well as incentivizing executives to accomplish our strategic objectives. 




TAX CONSIDERATIONS  
 Internal Revenue Code § 162(m).    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") eliminated the deductibility exemption for performance-based compensation
under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the next three highest paid officers whose compensation is required to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table of the proxy statement for 2018 and
beyond ("Covered Executives") will not be deductible. Once an individual becomes a Covered Executive for a tax year, that individual will remain a Covered Executive for all subsequent tax years,
including tax years after the individual's death. 
For
compensation awarded for years prior to 2018, Code Section 162(m) generally disallowed Federal tax deductions for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to Covered Executives,
other than the Chief Financial Officer; however, certain performance-based compensation was not subject to this deduction limitation. As noted above, the exemption from the Section 162(m)
deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Under the TCJA, performance-based compensation paid to
Covered Executives for years prior to 2018 in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of
November 2, 2017. Despite the Committee's efforts to structure the Covered Executives' Incentive Bonus and Performance Units in a manner intended to be exempt from the Section 162(m)
deduction limits, because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, no assurance can be

given
that such compensation will satisfy the requirements for exemption. Further, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from
Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with our business needs. Generally, we strive to maximize the tax deductibility of our compensation arrangements. In the
highly competitive market for talent, however, we believe the Committee needs flexibility in designing compensation that will attract and retain talented executives and provide special incentives to
promote various corporate objectives. The Committee, therefore, retains discretion to award compensation that is not fully tax deductible. 


 Internal Revenue Code § 409A.    Code Section 409A provides that amounts deferred under nonqualified deferred compensation plans are
includible in an employee's income when vested, unless certain requirements are met. If these requirements are not met, employees are also subject to an additional income tax and interest. All of our
supplemental retirement plans, severance arrangements, other nonqualified deferred compensation plans, as well as the Incentive Bonus Plan and our Long-Term Incentive Plans, are intended to meet these
requirements. As a result, employees are expected to be taxed when the deferred compensation is actually paid to them.

We
reviewed and discussed the findings of a risk assessment of these and other compensation policies and practices with the Compensation Committee, which also reviewed and discussed the findings with
the Committee's independent consultant, and concluded that our compensation programs are designed with an appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to our strategic objectives and do not
encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking behavior. As a result, we do not believe that risks relating to our compensation policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Company (see Risk Assessment Regarding Compensation Policies and Practices on pp. 15-16). Consequently, we did not make any significant changes to our executive
compensation practices for 2018 as a result of our compensation risk analysis. 






TIMING OF AWARDS  
Annual grants of equity awards are typically determined at February and/or March Compensation Committee meetings. At that time, data for previous performance
periods are available to determine the amount of the Final Awards. The Committee also decides the effective date of the Final Awards, and the annual equity-based grants of Time-Based Units and
Performance Units. In order to allow enough time for preparation of notification materials, the Committee approved the annual 2018 equity-based grants on February 14, 2018, and approved an
effective grant date of March 2, 2018. A similar practice was followed in previous years. This timing allows for the grants to be effective after the release of earnings information for the
prior fiscal year when the public is aware of the information and the information is reflected in the stock price used to value the awards.

The
Committee does not time equity grant dates to affect the value of compensation either positively or negatively. Executive officers do not play a role in the selection of grant dates. Special
grants, whether approved by the Compensation Committee for officers or the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Award Committee for non-officers, are effective either on a specified future date
(e.g., a date that coincides with a promotion or hiring date, or quarterly grant date), or 


the
date of approval. In the case of an approval by written consent, the grant date cannot be earlier than the date when the Committee member approvals have been obtained. See Corporate
Governance  Compensation Committee Operations at pp. 16-17 for more information on the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Award Committee. 






COMPENSATION PLANNING CYCLE  
The graphic below shows our annual compensation planning cycle. 








STOCK OWNERSHIP GOALS  
For several years the Compensation Committee has imposed stock ownership goals for executives at or above the Vice President level to further align the
interests of executives with those of shareholders. An executive has five years from taking his or her position to achieve the relevant officer level goal. The following table shows the officer level
and respective ownership goal. We review progress toward achievement of the ownership goals periodically. All forms of stock ownership  including directly and indirectly owned
shares of common stock, Time-Based Units, and units 


that
are based on common stock (excluding stock options and unearned Performance Units)  count toward the goal. As of December 31, 2018, all of the Named Executives complied
with the stock ownership goals.

*A
Performance Unit is an award of the right to earn up to a certain number of shares of common stock, Restricted Stock Units, or cash, or a combination of cash and
shares of common stock or Restricted Stock Units, based on performance against specified goals established by the Compensation Committee under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. A Time-Based Restricted
Stock Unit ("Time-Based Unit") represents the right to receive a share of common stock, or cash equivalent to the value of a share of common stock, when the restriction period ends, under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 

 

To
achieve our objectives and to support our business strategy, compensation paid to our executives is structured to ensure that there is an appropriate balance among the various forms of
compensation. The Committee attempts to strike appropriate balances by analyzing the competitive market for executive talent, our business results and forecasts, and our key strategic 


goals
for the year. The following comparisons, derived from the December 2018 Survey, show the various balances we achieved among our executive officer group (which includes officers in addition to
the Named Executives) compared to the balances achieved by the survey group:

As
the charts indicate, Ford's overall allocation is in line with the comparator group's median. 





BASE SALARY  
When considering increases to base salaries, the Compensation Committee takes into account the following factors:

 the individual's job duties, performance, and achievements; 
 similar positions of responsibility within the Company (internal pay equity); 
 job tenure, time since last salary increase, retention concerns, and critical skills; and 
 level of pay relative to comparable positions at companies in the survey group. 
The
Compensation Committee reviews salaries of the Named Executives annually and at the time of a promotion or other major change in responsibilities. Our 


December
2018 Survey results indicate that salary is slightly above the median for Mr. Hackett, is at the median for Mr. Shanks, and is above the median for Mr. Farley. We believe
that paying base salaries at or above the competitive survey is appropriate to retain executives throughout the business cycle. 
The
Committee decided to provide salary increases effective April 1, 2018, for Messrs. Shanks (13.0%), Hinrichs (2.5%), and Farley (10.0%). The increases for Messrs. Shanks and
Farley addressed internal equity and competitive concerns. Mr. Hackett did not receive a salary increase in 2018 in light of his salary increase upon his accession to the President and CEO role
in 2017. Also, Mr. Ford did not receive any base salary adjustment in 2018 in consideration of his desire to focus more of his compensation on equity-based grants.

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS  
As noted in Performance-Based Incentive Plans on pp. 42-43, the Committee applied corporate metrics for our Incentive Bonus Plan. The corporate metrics
and weightings incentivize our executives to work together as a team in achieving common objectives with the desire to advance our strategic objectives and enhance TSR. In addition, corporate metrics
in a global enterprise recognize the regional trade-offs that are frequently required to ensure overall corporate success on Company Adjusted EBIT Margin, Company Operating Cash Flow, and Company
Revenue. While the Committee generally established corporate metrics, the Quality metric was based on the weighted average of individual market and Business Unit objectives. In 2018, the Committee set
a formula that was based on the metrics set forth in the chart to the right for the Named Executives: 









The
Named Executives and their respective Incentive Bonus targets for the 2018 performance period were as follows:

The
Committee established targets for executive officers based on the individual's level of responsibility, competitive compensation data, internal pay equity considerations, past target amounts, as
well as the need for flexibility to motivate and reward exceptional performance. In accordance with prior practice for the President and CEO position, the Committee established the target of 200% of
salary for Mr. Hackett. The bonus target for Mr. Hackett was above the survey group's median, while the targets for Messrs. Shanks and Farley were at the median. 
In
light of Mr. Ford's arrangements which emphasize equity-based compensation, the Committee chose to maintain his Incentive Bonus target at $1 million, roughly 59% of his current
salary. The Committee believes this arrangement is more appropriate for the position of Executive Chairman and focuses his efforts on long-term objectives. 




2018 Incentive Bonus Plan Performance Results  
The amount earned under the Incentive Bonus Plan was determined pursuant to a pre-established sliding scale, based on various levels of achievement for each
metric. 
If
minimum performance levels had not been met for all metrics, the payout would have been zero. The scaling is based on a statistical methodology that takes into 


account
historical performance-to-objective for each of the metrics. The Committee believes that a scale which allows a maximum award of 200% of target incentivizes executives to exceed business
objectives. 
For
2018, the Incentive Bonus metrics of Company Revenue, Company Operating Cash Flow, and Company Adjusted EBIT Margin are different metrics than the 2017 metrics of Automotive Segment Revenue,
Automotive Segment Operating Margin, and Automotive Segment Operating Cash Flow. Accordingly, direct comparisons of whether a particular metric's target increased or decreased from the previous year
is not informative. Instead, we discuss whether the 2018 metrics' targets increased or decreased from the comparable 2017 actual performance of those metrics. 
As
discussed in Management Recommendations on pp. 42-43, the Committee determines the metrics and targets for our incentive plans for the coming year in December of the prior year based upon
our analysis and assumptions at that time. With that backdrop, the 2018 Company Revenue target increased from the 2017 Company Revenue actual performance because we expected a better product mix in a
U.S. auto market that was expected to be slightly lower than 2017. Company Adjusted EBIT Margin and Company Operating Cash Flow targets for 2018 were set lower because we expected lower profits in
2018 due to

increased
investments in emerging opportunities, higher commodity costs, and currency headwinds, among other items. These targets were also consistent with our external guidance for 2018. 
The
Company Operating Cash Flow metric is different from the Company Adjusted Operating Cash Flow that we report externally (see CD&A Roadmap on p. 37 and 2018  Laying the
Foundation discussion on p. 39). The primary difference is the exclusion of Ford Motor Credit Company dividends to Ford in the calculation of the Company Operating Cash Flow. For a reconciliation to
GAAP cash flow for the Company Operating Cash Flow (i.e., the Incentive Bonus metric) please refer to Appendix III. 


The
2018 Incentive Bonus Plan Results table below indicates an overall achievement of 72% for the 2018 performance period. We underperformed on the Company Revenue, Company Adjusted EBIT Margin, and
Company Operating Cash Flow metrics due to commodity costs increases, unfavorable exchange rates, warranty costs, and operational issues in Europe and China. We met the Quality metric. 
The
Committee decided to pay out the Incentive Bonus Plan awards to the Named Executives at the 72% of target level that was achieved (see column (f) of the Summary Compensation Table on
p. 60). The Committee believes a payout at the level achieved reinforces the performance-based nature of the Incentive Bonus Plan.

Pacific  42.2%. These weightings were based on the planned vehicle sales and registrations of the relevant Business Units for 2018. See the Quality Performance table below for an
explanation of the targets and results for the 2018 performance period.

INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN RESULTS 2018  QUALITY PERFORMANCE*  










*The
Global Quality metrics were developed from our Warranty Spending data and industry survey data that measures Things Gone Wrong and Customer Satisfaction at three
months in service. To better understand the Quality metrics, we show the targets as the expected year-over-year increase or decrease vs. the prior year actual performance. Bracketed numbers would
indicate expected year-over-year deterioration in the metrics while non-bracketed numbers indicate year-over-year improvements.

Incremental Bonuses  
The Committee has the ability to create an individual performance fund to recognize and reward exceptional performance. The Committee believes that certain
executives exhibited exceptional leadership skills in helping the Company achieve its 2018 results. Consequently, in February 2019, the Committee created an individual performance fund to recognize
and reward those executives, including Mr. Hinrichs, with incremental bonuses beyond the Incentive Bonuses earned for the 2018 performance year (see column (d) of the Summary
Compensation Table on p. 60). 
The
Committee viewed Mr. Hinrichs's 2018 performance as exceptional. Mr. Hinrichs coordinated with our Governmental Affairs Office the Company's response to various regulatory and trade
issues during 2018. Mr. Hinrichs's extensive knowledge of the automotive 


industry
and of Ford's automotive operations in particular were invaluable in protecting the interests of Ford and its stakeholders, including employees. In addition, Mr. Hinrichs continues to
make our Global Operations more fit while continuing to produce high quality vehicles. The Committee believed Mr. Hinrichs's leadership in these critical areas merited an incremental bonus. 




LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS  
Our equity-based incentive awards are tied to our performance and the future value of our common stock. These awards are intended to focus executive behavior
on our longer-term interests because today's business decisions affect Ford over a number of years. 
Based
on investor feedback and on management's desire to more closely align our equity compensation

with
shareholder interests, from 2015-2017 our equity-based compensation design included:

 Granting Time-Based Units (replaced stock options); 
 Three-year performance period for Performance Unit grants; 
 Relative TSR as a Performance Unit metric; and 
 Ratio of Performance Units to Time-Based Units at 75% : 25%. 
These
changes increased our compensation competitiveness and alignment with shareholder interests. However, based on a competitive peer survey group analysis by the Committee's consultant, for 2018
equity grants the Committee changed the ratio of Performance Units to Time-Based Units to 60% : 40%. This change better aligns our equity grant practices with our peer group and reduced compensation
risk to the Company's stock award participants. 
Another
change made for the 2018 equity grants that resulted from a peer group analysis was the accruing of dividend equivalents on unvested equity awards. Our analysis showed our peer group
consistently accrued dividend equivalents on unvested equity awards. In order to better align our practices with our peer group and to more closely align our equity grants with actual share ownership,
the Committee approved the accrual of dividend equivalents on Time-Based Units and Performance Units. 
For
Time-Based Units, dividend equivalents accrue as if reinvested resulting in additional Time-Based Units. The Committee decided that for 2018 grants when the underlying Time-Based Units vest, the
accrued Time-Based Units resulting from the dividend equivalents will be paid in cash based on the fair market value of a share of Ford common stock on the date of vest. 
For
Performance Units, dividend equivalents accrue as if reinvested resulting in additional Performance Units based on 100% of the target Performance Unit opportunity. The Committee decided that for
2018 grants, the accrued Performance Units will be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the fair market value of a share of Ford common stock on the date of vest;
however, the accrued Performance Units resulting from dividend equivalents are paid out based on the same performance factor as the underlying Performance Unit. For
example, if the performance factor for the underlying Performance Unit was 75%, then only 75% of the accrued Performance Units will be paid. 


In
general, the total value of equity-based grants in 2018 was determined based on the following considerations:

 job responsibilities and future contribution assessment to our long-term performance; 
 retention needs; 
 historical share allocations; 
 competitive level of grants for job matches in the survey group; 
 the value of equity-based grants made to the executive in the prior year; and 
 the total number of equity-based grants awarded to our employees. 
In
granting equity awards, the Committee determined a target dollar value of equity awards to grant to each recipient. For the Named Executives, this target dollar value was translated into a number
of Performance Units and Time-Based Units based on the fair market value of Ford common stock on the date of grant. In addition, the target dollar value of the annual equity awards to each of
Messrs. Shanks, Farley, and Hinrichs was approximately $3.7 million, which was consistent with internal equity and competitive market data. Time-Based Units will vest annually over a
period of three years from the grant dates. 
The
Committee approved an additional Time-Based Unit grant for Mr. Shanks valued at $3 million that will vest two years from the grant date. The Committee believed this retention grant
was appropriate in light of Mr. Shanks's key role in implementing our fitness redesign strategy. 
The
competitive survey indicates that equity-based compensation was at the median for Mr. Hackett, was above the median for Mr. Farley, and was slightly below the median for
Mr. Shanks, excluding his additional Time-Based Unit grant. 
We
understand that share-based compensation can be dilutive to shareholders. To address this concern, every year since 2012 we have implemented a modest share repurchase program of common stock in
order to offset the dilutive effect of share-based compensation. The Board of Directors has approved an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares for 2019. 




Time-Based Unit Grants  
For 2018, 40% of an executive's annual equity-based compensation was awarded in Time-Based Units. In general, these units vest over three years at a rate of
33%-33%-34%.

Performance Unit Grants  
Annual Performance Unit grants comprise 60% of an executive's equity-based compensation. The 2018 Performance Unit grants are measured through a mix of
internal and external financial metrics over a three-year period. The internal financial metrics have a 75% weighting, and the external financial metric has a 25% weighting. The internal metrics are
based on the forward year business plan approved at the December Board of Directors meeting immediately prior to the beginning of the three-year performance period  that is, the
metrics for the 2018 Performance Unit grants with a 2018-2020 performance period were based on our business plan approved at the December 2017 Board meeting. These metrics are fixed and are not
changed over the three-year performance period. 
The  internal financial metrics are as follows:

Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (weighted at 50%): Performance is measured against a three-year
average margin target. 
External Annual ROIC (weighted at 50%): Performance is measured against a three-year average
External Annual ROIC target. 
Performance
to these metrics is measured at the end of year three and is multiplied by a weighting of 75%. Similar to the Incentive Bonus Plan, the maximum that can be achieved for any one metric is
200%. 
Because
the 2018 Performance Unit grant has a three-year performance period, performance targets and performance results will not be disclosed until the 2021 Proxy Statement. We are not disclosing the
2018 Performance Unit targets now because providing three-year targets for our Company Adjusted EBIT Margin and External Annual ROIC would provide our competitors with insight into our business plan
that could substantially harm Ford's business interests. For example, disclosing our three-year Company Adjusted EBIT Margin target could provide competitors insight into our market share strategy and
potential entry into, or exit from, markets. Our three-year External Annual ROIC target can provide competitors insight into matters such as capital expenditures and potential cost cutting measures.
The Committee believes the targets to be achievable while incentivizing executives to exceed expectations. 
The
external financial metric is Ford's relative TSR performance compared to a peer group of companies. A key objective of our strategy to achieve
automotive leadership is to deliver superior TSR among automotive manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and major industrial companies. 


At
the end of the three-year performance period, Ford's TSR performance will be evaluated against a peer group of companies approved by the Committee at the time of the grant ("TSR Peer Group"). The
TSR Peer Group was comprised of the top ten automobile manufacturers (including Ford) by market capitalization, the top five automotive suppliers by market capitalization, and ten large industrial
companies with business models similar to Ford. The Committee decided to use a peer group of companies more closely aligned with our business (global automotive and manufacturing) than the
compensation survey group listed on p. 44 because our TSR performance is more competitively aligned with those companies, while our compensation peer group is more closely aligned with the market for
our executive talent. For the 2018 Performance Unit grants, the TSR Peer Group consisted of the following: 




Automotive Manufacturers:  











Toyota
 
 Ford


Daimler
 
 General Motors


Volkswagen

 Magna


Denso
 
 Valeo


Aptiv

 Deere


3M
 
 Caterpillar


Boeing
 
 General Dynamics


Honeywell
 
 Arconic




The
TSR performance is calculated as follows:

 90th percentile and above: 200% of target 
 greater than or equal to 75th to less than 90th percentile: 150%  199% of target  
 greater than or equal to 50th to less than 75th percentile: 100%  149% of target  
 greater than or equal to 25th to less than 50th percentile: 50%  99% of target  
 less than 25th percentile: 0% of target

factor
for Performance Units. This performance factor is multiplied by the Performance Unit target opportunity for the executive to produce the final award, ranging from 0% to 200% of the target
opportunity. The final award is paid in unrestricted shares of Ford common stock. 


The
Committee believes this structure provides appropriate incentives for executives to over-achieve in one or more metrics, and provides sufficient recognition for such over-achievement while not
encouraging excessive risk-taking behavior. 


The
graphic below demonstrates how the 2018 Performance Unit grant aligns executive interests with shareholder interests. 








2016 Performance Unit Results  
The performance period of the 2016 Performance Unit grant ended on December 31, 2018. The structure, metrics, and weightings for the 2016 Performance
Unit Grant are detailed in the charts below. The TSR peer group for the 2016 Performance Unit grant is the same as that shown on p. 54, except that it included Subaru,
Delphi, and Aisen Seiki and excluded Hyundai, Deere, Aptiv, and Valeo. In addition, DowDupont was two separate companies in 2016. 
The
2016 Performance Unit Results table on p. 56 indicates an overall achievement of 38% for the 2016-2018 performance period. The Committee decided to pay out the Performance Unit final awards to the 


Named
Executives at the 38% of the target level that was achieved. The Committee believed a payout at the level achieved was appropriate. This demonstrates our pay-for-performance philosophy.
Mr. Hackett was not an employee of the Company when the 2016 Performance Unit grants were made and, therefore, did not receive a final award. 
With
respect to the internal financial metrics, we underperformed on the Automotive Operating Margin, Automotive Operating Cash Flow, and Automotive Revenue metrics, while meeting the Ford Credit
Profit Before Tax metric. We also underperformed on the relative TSR metric (see 2016 Performance Unit Results table on p. 56).

BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES  
We provided certain perquisites and other benefits to senior management in 2018, the most significant of which are summarized below. The Committee annually
reviews our policies on perquisites and other benefits. The cost of these perquisites and other benefits are included in column (h) of the Summary Compensation Table on p. 60. 
 Personal Travel    Company policy does not allow the President and CEO or the Executive Chairman to fly commercially due to security concerns.
Consequently, the Company pays the costs associated with their use of private aircraft for business and personal travel. The families of these persons are allowed to accompany them on trips when they
travel on private aircraft. 
Requiring
the President and CEO and the Executive Chairman to use private aircraft for all travel provides significant benefits to Ford. First, the policy is intended to ensure their personal safety
as they both maintain significant public roles for Ford. Second, use of private aircraft maximizes their availability for Ford business. 
 Evaluation Vehicle Program    We maintain a program that provides certain employees with the use of two Company vehicles free of charge. This
program requires participants to provide written evaluations on a variety of our vehicles, providing important feedback on the design and quality of our products. 
 Other Services    For certain executive officers, including the Named Executives, we provide a home security evaluation and security system. We also
provide an allowance to senior managers for financial counseling services and estate planning. We pay for approximately 75% of the cost of the financial planning service up to $7,000. The safety and
security (personal and financial) of our executives is critically important. We believe the benefits of providing these programs outweigh the relatively minor costs associated with them. 
 Tax Reimbursement    The Committee has eliminated tax gross-ups for most executive perquisites. As part of the Company's temporary living/relocation
policy, however, the Company provides certain tax reimbursement for all levels of employees who relocate at the Company's request, including relocations pursuant to international service assignments.
The Committee believes that not reimbursing taxes for employees who move at the Company's request is an unfair financial burden. This policy removes any financial disincentive for an executive to
relocate and, therefore, enhances the Company's ability to have its executives gain experience in a variety of our global operations. 


In
addition, during 2016 the Internal Revenue Service informed us that it would begin to require us to impute the value of the vehicles provided to executives under the Evaluation Vehicle Program
discussed above. As a result, the Committee decided to provide tax relief for the participants of the program. The Evaluation Vehicle Program is available to Company officers and employees who are one
Leadership Level below the officer level. The Committee decided to provide tax reimbursement so that the Company could continue to receive participant vehicle evaluation data and to provide a valuable
benefit to our executives. 




RETIREMENT PLANS  
In general, we believe that the retirement plans described below serve several worthwhile business purposes, including retaining leadership talent, providing
income security to long serving executives, and providing flexibility to us in transferring executives among our operations. We believe these programs to be reasonable and appropriate in light of
competitive practices and our executives' total compensation program. For additional information, see the Pension Benefits in 2018 table on pp. 65-66 and the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018
table on p. 67. 



The
amounts shown in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table on p. 60 can vary significantly year to year. These amounts are driven by assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality
tables, as well as plan design, years of service, base pay, and the age of the employee. These amounts do not reflect compensation that was paid for any year shown. 



 Pre-2004 Plans    Our General Retirement Plan ("GRP") provides a tax-qualified defined benefit for each year of non-contributory participation by
employees in the U.S. hired before January 1, 2004, and added benefits for those who make contributions. We also have three other nonqualified retirement plans for certain eligible employees.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") provides a supplemental monthly benefit calculated on a percentage of final average pay and service. The Benefit Equalization Plan ("GRP-BEP")
provides eligible employees with benefits substantially equal to those they could have received under the GRP but were not able to because of Internal Revenue Code limitations. The Executive

employment
after age 55 (age 52 if retiring under our Select Retirement Plan ("SRP")). 
The
SRP is a voluntary retirement program offered from time-to-time for select U.S. management employees. The Committee believes the SRP provides flexibility in executive succession planning. 
Messrs. Ford,
Shanks, and Hinrichs are eligible for benefits under the GRP, SERP, GRP-BEP, and ESAP. During the period for which Mr. Ford did not receive a cash salary
(i.e., November 2001 through July 2010), each of these plans, including the SRP, had been amended in order to provide him with benefits using a notional annual base salary. 
Benefits
under SERP, SRP, ESAP, and GRP-BEP are not funded. In addition, in accordance with Code Section 409A, benefits that accrued or vested on or after January 1, 2005 under these
plans may not be paid to certain key executives until at least six months following their separation from employment. 
 Post-January 1, 2004 Plan    Consistent with our Strategy Statement (see Compensation Philosophy and Strategy on pp. 41-42) to develop
benefit programs that provide employees with income security and protection from catastrophic loss while minimizing our long-term liabilities, Ford adopted a tax qualified defined contribution
retirement plan, the Ford Retirement Plan ("FRP"), for salaried employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2004 in the U.S. 


The
FRP was adopted in order to provide us with more predictable retirement benefit costs and reduced financial statement volatility. These goals are achieved through a stable contribution schedule
and the transfer of financial and demographic risks from us to plan participants while still providing employees with the opportunity for adequate income in retirement. We also have nonqualified plans
for employees who participate in the FRP. Under the FRP-Benefit Equalization Plan ("FRP-BEP"), employees, including Messrs. Hackett and Farley, receive benefits substantially equal to those
they would have received under the FRP but were not able to because of Internal Revenue Code limitations. The Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("DC SERP") provides certain
executives a notional account balance which provides retirement benefits in addition to those provided by the FRP. Company contributions are calculated as a percentage of base salary based on the
executive's age and position. To be eligible for DC SERP payments after separation, an executive must be at least age 55 with 10 years of Company service, have at least 5 years of
service at Leadership Level 4 or above immediately preceding separation, and separate with Company approval. Employees who participate in the FRP, including Messrs. Hackett and Farley,
are not eligible to participate in the GRP (with respect to future service), GRP-BEP, SRP, SERP, or ESAP. 






At
the 2018 Annual Meeting, we asked you to approve the compensation of the Named Executives as presented in our 2018 Proxy Statement. You approved the compensation of the Named Executives with 96.1%
of the votes cast "For" approval. This result was consistent with the 2015-2017 Say-on-Pay results, which had approval rates of around 97.0%. We are pleased that investors support our compensation
philosophy, policies, and programs. 
We
met with institutional investors in the autumn of 2018 to discuss corporate governance topics and any executive compensation related concerns. In general, investors were pleased with the changes we
made to our compensation programs in 2015 and did not note any additional concerns. 


Beginning
in 2016, the Committee modified the terms and conditions applicable to equity-based awards so that upon a change-in-control of the Company where Ford is not the surviving entity, unvested
awards will terminate if such awards have been replaced by comparable awards from the acquiring corporation, unless any recipient is terminated or there is a reduction in an executive's
responsibilities as of the date of the change-in-control. In those cases, or in the event awards are not replaced with comparable awards, such unvested awards will vest immediately prior to the
change-in-control. The Committee adopted this change in order to bring our provisions in line with market practice and shareholder preferences.

1The
amount shown for 2018 reflects a discretionary bonus award paid in 2019 for 2018 performance (see Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  Incremental Bonuses on p. 52); amounts shown for 2017 reflect discretionary bonus awards paid in 2018 for 2017 performance and in Mr. Hackett's
case, reflects an award upon his accession to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer; and the amount shown for 2016 reflects a discretionary bonus award paid in 2017 for 2016 performance.
2The
amounts shown in column (e) reflect the aggregate grant date value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for stock-based awards for
each of the Named Executives for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. The assumptions used for the 2018, 2017, and 2016 calculations can be found at Note 6 to our audited
financial statements in Ford's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018; Note 6 to our audited financial statements in Ford's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017; and Note 20 to our audited financial statements in Ford's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016, respectively. Pursuant to SEC rules, we disregarded the estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions.  

For
stock awards granted in 2018, 2017, and 2016, the amounts shown in column (e) reflect grant date values for both Time-Based Units and Performance Units. For those portions of the amounts
that relate to the 2018, 2017, and 2016 Performance Units, such amounts reflect the grant date values of such awards that are subject to performance conditions (internal financial metrics) and market
conditions (relative TSR performance). The grant date values shown above for the 2018, 2017, and 2016 Performance Units are reported based upon the probable outcome of such conditions as of the
respective dates of grant. Pursuant to SEC rules, for those parts of the Performance Unit grants that are subject to performance conditions, the following table shows the values of such awards at
their respective grant dates assuming that the highest levels of the performance conditions are achieved. For those parts of the Performance Unit grants that are subject to market conditions, the
potential maximum values are factored into the awards' calculated grant date fair values (see Long-Term Incentive Awards on pp. 52-55 for a discussion of the 2018 Performance Unit grants, the internal
financial metrics, relative TSR metric, and the weightings of each).

3The
amounts shown in column (f) reflect awards earned by the Named Executives under the Incentive Bonus Plan (see Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  Annual Cash Incentive Awards on pp. 50-52).
4The
amounts shown in column (g) reflect the net increase, if any, in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under the various
Company plans arising from the passage of time, additional benefits accrued, and changes in the actuarial assumptions. The combined impact of these elements during 2018 resulted in an increase in
present value for Mr. Hinrichs and a decrease in present value for Messrs. Shanks and Ford. For Messrs. Shanks and Ford, a zero is shown in the table above per proxy rules. For
Mr. Hinrichs, the primary driver of the present value increase was the value of additional benefits accrued exceeding the decrease arising from an increase in discount rates. This was not the
case for Messrs. Shanks and Ford during 2018. For 2018, the accrued pension benefits are measured from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018; for 2017, the accrued pension
benefits are measured from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017; and for 2016, the accrued pension benefits are measured from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. For
2018, the decrease in the actuarial present value of accrued pension benefits for Mr. Ford was $1,423,292; and for Mr. Shanks was $119,145. Messrs. Hackett and Farley do not
participate in the Company's defined pension benefits plans. See the Pension Benefits in 2018 table and related footnotes on pp. 65-66 for additional information, including the present value
assumptions used in these calculations. None of the Named Executives received preferential or above-market earnings on deferred compensation.

following table summarizes the amounts shown in column (h) for 2018.

iFor
a description of perquisites relating to personal use of private aircraft, our Evaluation Vehicle Program, and security, financial planning, and
other services for Named Executives, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Benefits and Perquisites on p. 57. Other perquisites and personal benefits whose
incremental costs are included in the amounts shown consist of the following: personal use of Company cell phones, foreign tax preparation fees related to international assignments, personal use of
car and driver service, annual executive health exams, spousal incidental charges when accompanying the executive on business trips, charitable gifts related to Company Board service, ground
transportation services, fuel and car washes related to the evaluation vehicles, temporary housing/living expenses, and relocation expenses.  

Executives
also may make personal use of Company season tickets to athletic events, but such use does not result in incremental cost to the Company because the tickets are for business use and when
the executive uses them for personal use, the executive pays for any additional costs associated with such personal use.  
Amounts
for the Named Executives include the incremental costs to the Company for providing certain perquisites and other benefits during 2018. For Mr. Ford, the amount shown includes $245,658
for personal use of aircraft and $909,891 for security. For Mr. Hackett, the amount shown includes $104,342 for personal use of aircraft.  
During
2018, for use of private aircraft, we calculated the aggregate incremental cost using a method that takes into account the following: (i) the variable cost per flight hour, including
supplies and catering, aircraft fuel, and oil expenses, maintenance, parts, and external labor, and flight crew travel expenses; (ii) landing/parking/hangar storage expenses; (iii) any
customs, foreign permit, and similar fees; and (iv) positioning flight costs. We calculated the aggregate incremental cost of security as the actual cost incurred to provide these benefits. We
calculated the aggregate incremental cost of providing the evaluation vehicles by estimating the lease fee for a comparable vehicle under

our
Management Lease Program. The lease fee under that program takes into account the cost of using the vehicle, maintenance, license, title and registration fees, and insurance.  


iiAs
stated in the CD&A, we provide tax benefits to those employees who relocate at the Company's request. We also provide tax relief for the imputed
income from our Evaluation Vehicle Program. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Benefits and Perquisites on p. 57 for a discussion of our Tax Reimbursement
policy.
iiiAmounts
shown reflect the dollar value of premiums paid by the Company for life insurance in an amount equal to three times an employee's salary.
Employees may purchase additional life insurance and these premiums are payroll deducted with no additional Company contributions or cost.
ivThe
amounts shown for Messrs. Hackett and Farley reflect contributions made to their Ford Retirement Plan accounts (see Compensation Discussion
and Analysis  Retirement Plans on pp. 57-58) and Company matching contributions to their 401(k) accounts. The amounts for the other Named Executives reflect
Company matching contributions to their employee 401(k) accounts.
vThe
amounts shown for Messrs. Shanks, Ford, and Hinrichs primarily reflect contributions made to a nonqualified benefit equalization plan related
to the Company's 401(k) plan (see Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018 table and footnotes 1 and 2 on p. 67). The amounts shown for Messrs. Hackett and Farley primarily reflect Company
contributions to a nonqualified benefit equalization plan related to the Ford Retirement Plan and contributions made to a nonqualified benefit equalization plan related to the Company's 401(k) plan.

1The
amounts shown in columns (e) and (f) represent the target and maximum amounts payable for 2018 performance under the Incentive Bonus
Plan. Our Incentive Bonus Plan does not have a formal threshold award in that there is no minimum amount payable for a certain level of performance under the plan. The Compensation Committee exercises
discretion as to whether to make payouts if performance does not achieve target levels. The material terms of the awards are described in Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  Annual Cash Incentive Awards at pp. 50-52. For actual payouts made under the Incentive Bonus Plan for 2018 performance, see column (f) of the
Summary Compensation Table on p. 60.
2For
each of the Named Executives, the amounts shown in columns (h) and (i) consist of annual grants of Performance Units that provide an
opportunity to earn a Final Award of unrestricted common stock for 2018-2020 performance. The amounts shown represent the target and maximum amounts of the opportunity. The 2018 Performance Unit
grants do not have a formal threshold award in that there is no minimum amount payable for a certain level of performance under the grants. The Compensation Committee exercises discretion as to
whether to make payouts if performance does not achieve target levels. 2018-2020 performance will be measured against the metrics and weightings discussed in Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  Long-Term Incentive Awards on pp. 52-55. The Final Awards that will be earned, if any, for 2018-2020 performance will be paid out in unrestricted
shares of Ford common stock, less shares withheld to pay tax obligations.
3The
amounts shown in column (j) represent Time-Based Unit grants. The Time-Based Units generally have a vesting feature whereby one-third of each
grant vests after the first anniversary of the grant date, an additional one-third after the second anniversary, and the final one-third after the third anniversary. If a grantee retires, becomes
disabled, or dies, his or her grant continues to vest according to the

vesting schedule. In most other instances of employment termination, all grants generally end upon termination of employment. Time-Based Units are subject to certain conditions, including not
engaging in competitive activity. Time-Based Units generally cannot be transferred except through inheritance. In general, each grantee agrees to remain a Ford employee for at least six months from
the date of the grant. Mr. Shanks received a Time-Based Unit grant in March. This grant will vest in full two years from the grant date (see Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  Long-Term Incentive Awards on p. 53).  


4The
amounts shown in column (k) represent the full grant date value of each equity-based award shown in the table for each Named Executive
computed under FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions used in calculating the grant date value can be found at Note 6 to our audited financial statements in Ford's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2018. For awards subject to performance conditions, the values shown are based upon the probable outcome of such conditions as of the grant date.

the 2016, 2017, and 2018 grants of Time-Based Units, in general, these units vest over three years at a rate of 33%-33%-34%. The amount shown for Mr. Hackett in the 2016 Annual Grant column
reflects a Time-Based Unit grant he received upon his accession to the role of Chairman, Ford Smart Mobility, LLC. The amount shown for Mr. Hackett under the Special Grants column
reflects a grant he received upon his accession as President and CEO. These Time-Based Units will vest over three years at a rate of 33%-33%-34%. The amounts shown for Messrs. Farley and
Hinrichs under the Special Grants column reflect retention awards. These Time-Based Units will vest in full three years from the respective grant dates. The amount shown for Mr. Shanks under
the Special Grants column reflects a Time-Based Unit grant awarded in March 2018, which will vest two years from the grant date. When the Time-Based Units included in the table above vest, shares of
Ford common stock will be issued, less shares withheld for tax obligation.  
Dividend
Equivalents will not accrue nor be paid during the restriction period for grants awarded in 2016 and 2017. For 2018 grants, Dividend Equivalents accrue during the restriction period and will
be paid in cash upon vesting of the underlying award (see Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Long-Term Incentive Awards on p. 53).  
In
addition to the above, the amounts shown for Messrs. Hackett and Ford include 1,140 and 3,484 Ford common stock units, respectively, resulting from deferral of director fees and Dividend
Equivalents that were credited to their accounts pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors while they served as non-employee directors of the Company. Such units will be
converted and paid in cash on January 10 of the year, or equally on January 10 over the three years (as in the case of Mr. Hackett), following termination of Board service, based
upon the fair market value of a share of Ford common stock on December 31 of the preceding year.  


3The
market value shown was determined by multiplying the number of units shown in column (f) by the closing price of Ford common stock, $7.65, on
December 31, 2018.
4The
amounts shown for the Named Executives consist of the annual Performance Unit grants for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 performance periods as follows
(see also Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Long-Term Incentive Awards on pp. 52-56):

Final
awards will be made in unrestricted shares of common stock at the conclusion of the three-year performance period. For Mr. Hackett the amount of the 2017 grant consists of 201,421
Performance Units granted in March 2017 in his role as Chairman of Ford Smart Mobility, LLC and 472,972 Performance Units granted upon his accession to the role of President and CEO in May
2017.  
Dividend
Equivalents will not accrue nor be paid during the performance period for grants awarded in 2016 and 2017. For 2018 grants, Dividend Equivalents accrue during the performance period and will
be paid in cash upon granting of the Final Award based upon the performance factor achieved on the underlying Performance Unit grant (see Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Long-Term Incentive Awards on p. 53).  


5The
market value shown was determined by multiplying the number of units shown in column (h) by the closing price of Ford common stock, $7.65, on
December 31, 2018. The number of units assumes that the target level was achieved for the Performance Units granted in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

1The
amounts shown in columns (c) and (e) represent the aggregate dollar value realized by the Named Executives upon the exercising of
stock options and/or the vesting of stock awards. We computed the aggregate dollar value realized upon the exercise of stock options by multiplying the number of shares realized upon exercise by the
difference between the market price of our stock at exercise and the exercise price of the options. We computed the aggregate dollar value realized upon vesting by multiplying the number of shares of
stock vested by the fair market value (closing price) of Ford common stock on the vesting date.

1The
General Retirement Plan ("GRP") provides a flat-rate defined benefit of up to $47.45 per month for each year of non-contributory participation by
employees in the United States hired before January 1, 2004, and contributory benefits for each year of contributory participation in which salaried employees contribute 1.5% of base salary up
to the applicable limit of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code")  $275,000 in 2018.  

Contributory
benefits are calculated as follows: 




















 
Contributory Benefit
 
=
 
(1.5% × Final Avg. Pay) × Contributory Service Years,
 
 
 
0.4% × Final Avg. Pay in excess of


 
 
 
 
 
plus up to two years of waiting period service
 
+

Table of Contents


"Final
Average Pay" is the average of the five highest consecutive December 31 monthly base salaries out of the last 10 years of contributory participation.  
"Breakpoint"
is 150% of Covered Compensation as of January 1 of the year of retirement.  
"Covered
Compensation" is the average of the Social Security wage base for the preceding 35 years for someone reaching normal retirement age.  
Normal
retirement is at age 65 with one or more years of credited pension service. Eligible employees who are age 55-64 and have at least 10 years of credited pension service, or employees with
30 or more years of credited pension service who are not yet age 65, may elect to retire early and receive reduced contributory and non-contributory benefits. In addition, Social Security bridging
benefits are payable until age 62 and one month. Survivorship coverage is available under the GRP. Under the normal payment method for married participants (65% Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity),
there is a 5% reduction in benefits where the spouse is within five years of the employee's age.  
The
Benefit Equalization Plan ("GRP-BEP") provides eligible U.S. employees with benefits substantially equal to those that would have been provided under the GRP but that could not be provided because
of Code limitations. 65% survivorship coverage is also available under the BEP.  
The
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") provides certain eligible executives with an additional monthly benefit after separation from service equal to Final Five Year Average Base Salary
multiplied by credited pension service and further multiplied by an applicable percentage (0.2% to 0.9% depending upon position at separation from service), reduced for separation from service prior
to age 62. To be eligible, an executive must separate from service with the approval of the Company at or after age 55, have at least 10 years of credited pension service, and must generally
have at least five continuous years of service at an eligible position. The SERP monthly benefit has no surviving spouse benefit. In addition, the SERP may provide annuities based on Company earnings,
the executive's performance, and other factors. In addition, for separation from service effective October 1, 1998 or later, for certain U.S. Vice Presidents and above whose careers include
foreign subsidiary service, the SERP provides an additional monthly pension parity benefit to equalize the total retirement benefits payable from the Company's retirement plans to an amount that would
have been payable under the GRP and GRP-BEP if the executive's subsidiary service had been recognized as contributory service under those plans. The pension parity provides 65% survivorship coverage. 
The
Executive Separation Allowance Plan ("ESAP") provides benefits to certain eligible executives who have at least five years of eligible executive service, have at least ten years of GRP
contributory membership, and who separate from employment after age 55 and prior to age 65. Benefits are payable (reduced by any GRP or GRP-BEP benefit distribution) to the eligible executive or his
or her eligible surviving spouse until the executive reaches age 65. The amount of the benefit is a percentage of monthly base salary (not to exceed 60%) based on age and service equal to 1% per year
of service (but not less than 15%) plus 1/2% for each month that age at separation exceeds 55 (maximum of 30%).  
To
achieve several business goals, we may offer benefits under the Select Retirement Plan ("SRP"), a voluntary separation program offered from time-to-time for select U.S. management employees. To be
eligible, selected employees generally had to be at least age 52 with 10 or more years of service. In general, the SRP adds three years of age and contributory service and uses "enhanced Final Average
Salary" for purposes of calculating benefits based on the formulas under the GRP, GRP-BEP, SERP, and ESAP, with a minimum increase of 15% over regular benefits. Enhanced Final Average Salary is
calculated by multiplying present base salary times three, then adding the last two year-end salaries and dividing the total by five.  
The
following assumptions are used in calculating the present value of the accumulated benefit:

 The age at which benefits are assumed payable is the greater of (i) present age or (ii) age 65 for the GRP and GRP-BEP; age 62 for
the SERP; and age 55 for the ESAP. Present age is measured as of December 31, 2018. 
 Present compensation is used for purposes of the benefit calculations. 
 Present Value of Accumulated Benefit (column (d)) is calculated assuming a single life annuity; modified RP-2014 mortality table projected
generationally; and a discount rate of 4.341% for the GRP; 4.284% for the SERP; 4.285% for the GRP-BEP; 3.893% for the ESAP; and 4.189% for the SRP as of December 31, 2018.  
 The present values include amounts relating to employee contributions.  

Code
Section 409A governs the timing for income inclusion of amounts under our supplemental retirement plans. We believe our supplemental retirement plans presently meet the requirements of
Code Section 409A. As a result, employees generally will be taxed when compensation is received under these plans; however, distribution of these amounts may be delayed for six months following
separation from service.  



2The
SERP, GRP-BEP, and ESAP plans provided Mr. Ford with a benefit using a notional base annual salary for November 2001 through August 2010
because he did not receive a cash salary for that period.
3Messrs. Hackett
and Farley do not participate in the GRP, SERP, GRP-BEP, or ESAP. Ford has a different tax qualified defined contribution
retirement plan, the Ford Retirement Plan ("FRP"), for salaried employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2004 in the U.S. See Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018 table on p. 67.

1The
nontax-qualified defined contribution plan represented in the above table is the benefit equalization plan with sub-accounts that relate to the
Savings and Stock Investment Plan ("SSIP") and the Ford Retirement Plan ("FRP"). This plan is unfunded. Notional amounts are credited by book entry to the participant's account. Participants choose
how to allocate the notional amounts from a menu of investment measurement options used solely for the purpose of valuing the participants' accounts. These are considered notional investments. The
performance of an individual's investment option(s) tracks the notional value as if an actual investment was made in such option(s).  

For
the BEP-SSIP sub-account, investment options include: target-date retirement funds; passively and actively managed domestic, global, and international equity funds; fixed income funds; a Company
common stock fund; a real asset fund; and a stable value fund. Participants may change their investment elections at any time. The BEP-FRP sub-account offers a subset of these investment measurement
options, which does not include a Company common stock fund. Distribution of account balances from these nonqualified plans may be delayed for six months in accordance with Code Section 409A. 
The
BEP-SSIP sub-account preserves benefits that are substantially equal to any Company matching contributions that would have been made under the SSIP but limited due to Code limitations. Likewise,
the BEP-FRP sub-account provides notional credits equivalent to Company contributions that would have been made under the FRP account but for Code limitations.  
The
FRP is a tax-qualified, defined contribution profit sharing plan for employees hired or rehired beginning January 1, 2004. The Company makes scheduled contributions to a participant's FRP
account calculated as a percentage of base salary using a percentage established based on an employee's age. The Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("DC SERP") provides
certain executives a notional account balance which provides retirement benefits in addition to those provided by the FRP. To be eligible for DC SERP Company contributions, an executive must be hired
on or after January 1, 2004 and be Leadership Level 4 (LL4) or above. Company contributions are calculated as a percentage of base salary based on the executive's age and position. To be
eligible for DC SERP payments after separation, an executive must be at least age 55 with 10 years of Company service, have at least 5 years of service at LL4 or above immediately
preceding separation, and separate from service with Company approval.  
Initial
notional credits to both the BEP: SSIP/FRP sub-accounts and Company contributions to the FRP are allocated to each sub-account's and FRP default investment option. Thereafter, participants may
transfer the credits to the BEP-SSIP/FRP and the Company contributions to the FRP to any other investment option available under the respective plans and also elect how any future notional credits and
Company contributions are allocated. Vested account balances of both the BEP-SSIP/FRP sub-accounts are distributed in cash in a lump sum as soon as practicable after death or separation from Ford. An
employee becomes fully vested under these sub-accounts three years from their original date of hire with Ford. All of the Named Executives participate in the BEP-SSIP. In addition,
Messrs. Hackett and Farley participate in the BEP-FRP.  


2The
amounts shown in column (c) for the Named Executives are reflected in column (h) of the Summary Compensation Table on p. 60 and
represents credits made to their SERP and BEP-SSIP/FRP sub-accounts, respectively.
3None
of the amounts shown in column (d) are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table.
4The
following amounts were reported in the Summary Compensation Table in prior years: Mr. Hackett: $269,177; Mr. Shanks: $141,862;
Mr. Ford: $473,512; Mr. Farley: $349,386; and Mr. Hinrichs: $176,979.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL  

We
maintain certain plans whereby we provide compensation and benefits to executives, including the Named Executives, in the event of a termination of employment. For disclosure of benefits pursuant
to employment separation under our qualified and nonqualified pension plans for each of the Named Executives, see the Pension Benefits in 2018 table and related footnotes on pp. 65-66. For disclosure
of payments due, if any, to each of the Named Executives pursuant to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans, please see the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018 table and related footnotes
on p. 67. In the table below, Messrs. Shanks and Ford are shown as receiving amounts in the "Retirement Eligible" column because they qualify as retirement eligible under our
plans. 
We
do not have any formal agreements with any Named Executive regarding acceleration of awards, and we do not have any formal agreements with any Named Executive regarding provision of benefits
related to termination of employment; however, each of the 


Named
Executives may be entitled to certain compensation and benefits under our plans in such circumstances. Award agreements under our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide that a change in control
occurs upon any merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity. As noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis  2018 Say-on-Pay on p. 58, the
Compensation Committee adopted a double trigger change-in-control provision beginning with equity grants made in 2016. Under this provision, an executive's employment would have to be terminated or
his duties reduced before any accelerated vesting of equity awards in a change-in-control situation. 
The
following tables for the Named Executives assume that the relevant triggering event occurred on December 31, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, the fair market values of stock-based compensation
(e.g., Performance Units or Restricted Stock Units) were calculated using the closing price of Ford common stock ($7.65) on the NYSE on December 31, 2018.

column (f) of the Summary Compensation Table on p. 60. Since the amounts in column (d) of the Summary Compensation Table are paid at
the discretion of the Compensation Committee, they are not considered as a payment due upon termination.
2The
2016, 2017, 2018 Performance Unit opportunities have three-year performance periods, ending December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and
December 31, 2020, respectively (see column (h) of Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table and footnote 4 on pp. 63-64). The amounts shown in the Change In Control
column above reflect the value of the performance to metrics of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 Performance Unit opportunities as of December 31, 2018. In each case we multiplied the Performance Unit
target opportunity (see Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table and footnote 4 on pp. 63-64) by the performance-to-metrics as of December 31, 2018, which was 38% for the 2016
Performance Unit grant, 41% for the 2017 Performance Unit grant, and 34% for the 2018 Performance Unit grant. We multiplied that product by the fair market value of Ford common stock at
December 31, 2018, which was $7.65. For terminations resulting from death or disability or for those Named Executives who are retirement eligible, the 2016, 2017, and 2018 Performance Unit
grants provide that the executive will receive 100% of the final award determined by the Compensation Committee at the end of the respective three-year performance period. Consequently, the value of
that final award, if any, cannot be determined at this time; however, SEC rules require a reasonable estimate be made of such value. We decided to use the same performance-to-metrics (38%, 41%, and
34%) as of December 31, 2018, as a reasonable estimate of the possible value of the final awards to be made in 2019, 2020 and 2021.

3At
December 31, 2018, each of the following Named Executives had unvested Restricted Stock Units as follows: Mr. Hackett: 739,199;
Mr. Shanks: 502,370; Mr. Ford: 589,274; Mr. Farley: 676,474; and Mr. Hinrichs: 675,979. The amounts shown indicate the fair market value of the unvested Restricted Stock
Units as of December 31, 2018 (see footnote 2 to the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table on p. 64). The awards will vest according to the normal vesting schedule in the
event of early retirement or normal retirement and will vest immediately in the event of death or disability, except that the retention awards for Messrs. Shanks, Farley, and Hinrichs only vest if
they are employed on the date of vest. For Time-Based Units, if a change in control occurs and Ford is not the surviving entity, unvested Time-Based Units will terminate if such awards have been
replaced by comparable awards from the acquiring entity, unless any recipient is terminated or there is a reduction in an executive's responsibilities as of the date of the change in control. In those
cases, or in the event awards are not replaced with comparable awards, such unvested awards will vest immediately prior to the change in control. Restricted Stock Units are subject to clawback
provisions if they resulted from final awards of Performance Units (see Corporate Governance  Risk Assessment Regarding Compensation Policies and Practices on pp. 15-16).
Restricted Stock Units are also subject to forfeiture for violations of non-compete provisions and occurrences of conduct inimical towards the Company.
4The
amount shown for evaluation vehicles under the "Retirement Eligible" column reflects the annual cost of providing vehicles for 2018 under the
Evaluation Vehicle Program for each executive (see footnote (i) to the All Other Compensation in 2018 table on pp. 61-62). The amounts shown under the "Death or Disability" column for the Named
Executives reflect the three-year average costs for vehicles under our surviving spouse vehicle program. Under that program, the surviving spouse receives a car allowance to purchase one of our
products. The costs include the A-Plan price of the vehicle, sales tax, and title, registration, and document fees.
5The
amounts shown include: (i) proceeds from Company paid life insurance; and (ii) a death benefit payable to the next of kin in an amount
equal to 80 hours of salary at the hourly rate.

1The
number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2018 Plan is based on a formula. The 2018 Plan provides that the maximum
number of shares that may be available for Plan Awards (awards of shares of common stock, options, Performance Units, and various other rights relating to common stock) each year is equal to 2% of the
total number of issued shares of common stock as of December 31 of the prior year. This limit is called the 2% Limit. The 2% Limit may be increased to up to 3% in any year, with a corresponding
reduction in the number of shares available in later years under the 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2017, the total number of issued shares of common stock was 3,987,071,864 shares and 2% of
such number is 79,741,437 shares. 3% of such number is 119,612,156 shares. Additionally, any unused portion of the 2% Limit for any year may be carried forward and used in later years. Since the 2018
Plan became effective May 1, 2018, there are no carryover shares from previous years. There were 546,752 shares used during 2018 under the 2018 Plan and 43,862 shares were forfeited during
2018.  

The
number of securities remaining available for issuance under the 2014 Plan is 8,858,104. The 2014 Plan originally had 10,000,000 shares authorized. As of December 31, 2018, 1,141,896
Restricted Stock Units had been granted under the 2014 Plan.  
Additional
shares may be issued under a deferred compensation plan as a result of future Dividend Equivalents, if we pay dividends on our common stock.  
On
March 4, 2019, 15,357,414 Restricted Stock Units were granted to certain executives as part of a long-term incentive program.  


2This
number includes the following:


(i)Long-Term
Incentive Plans
27,454,670
shares subject to options; 31,691,367 shares covered by Restricted Stock Units; 8,893,999 shares of restricted stock; 23,682,483 shares

PAY RATIO  
As required by proxy rules, we are providing the following pay ratio information with respect to the 2018 fiscal
year:

 the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than the CEO) was $64,316; 
 the total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hackett, was $17,752,835; and 
 based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total
compensation of all employees is 276 to 1. 




Methodology  
SEC rules provide that we may use the same median employee for three years before identifying a new median employee provided that during our last completed
fiscal year there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. We do
not believe that there has been a change to our employee population or our employee compensation arrangements that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. Consequently, with
respect to the identification of the median employee compensation of all employees (excluding the CEO), the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to
identify the median and determine total compensation (or any elements of total compensation) in 2017 were as follows:

 We used December 31, 2017 as the date to determine our workforce for purposes of determining the median compensated employee. As of
December 31, 2017, our workforce consisted of approximately 202,256 employees, with 89,004 (44.0%) of those employees located in the United States, and 113,252 (56.0%) employees located outside
of the United States. 
 The de minimis exception of the pay ratio rules allows us to exclude up to 5% of our employees based outside of the U.S. Pursuant to the de
minimis exception, we excluded 7,753 of our non-U.S. employees (approximately 3.8%

 As a global enterprise, Ford maintains multiple payroll systems around the world. In determining the median employee compensation (other than
our CEO's compensation), we used total taxable income of each employee as of December 31, 2017. This is often referred to as the "Box 5" number on U.S. W-2 forms. We asked our foreign
consolidated subsidiaries to provide an equivalent total taxable income number for employees located in their countries. For employees located outside of the U.S., we converted local currency
compensation using the Book Average Internal Revenue Service published rate at December 31, 2017. Also, for those countries that have a non-calendar tax year, we used the total taxable income
for all of 2017. 
 For employees who were on leave during any part of 2017, we did not annualize their compensation due to the complexity and uncertainty inherent
in the manual calculations required; instead, the compensation they actually received was used. We did, however, annualize the compensation of employees hired during 2017.  
 Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a full-time, salaried employee located in the U.S., with 2017 total taxable
income of $58,693. We then calculated the median employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which is the manner in which
we calculate the total compensation of our Named Executive Officers as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, resulting in annual total compensation in the amount of $64,316. It should be noted
that the amount used to identify the median compensated employee reflects 2017 taxable income, whereas the annual total compensation amount reflects such employee's compensation as determined under
the proxy rule identified above for 2018 compensation. That calculation takes into account certain benefits and compensation not included in the employee's 2018 taxable income, including the Incentive
Bonus payment for 2018 performance, which is paid in 2019, and the increase, if any, in the present value of the employee's pension. For 2018, the present value of the median employee's pension
decreased and, therefore, the value was zero when determining the employee's total compensation per Item 402(c)(2)(viii), Instruction 3.

Proposal 4.
Approval of Tax Benefit Preservation Plan 

On
September 13, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the "Plan") between us and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as rights agent. The Plan, which
is designed to preserve our substantial tax assets, was originally entered into in September 2009 and was scheduled to expire at the close of business on September 11, 2012. Amendment
No. 1 to the Plan was entered into on September 11, 2012, and extended the expiration date of the Plan to September 30, 2015. Amendment No. 2 to the Plan was entered into
on September 9, 2015, and extended the expiration date of the Plan to September 30, 2018. Amendment No. 3 to the Plan, which was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors,
extends the expiration date of the Plan to September 30, 2021 (subject to other earlier termination events, including final adjournment of our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders if shareholder
approval of the extension has not been received prior to that time). Other than changing the termination provisions as summarized in the immediately preceding sentence, Amendment No. 3 did not
change the Plan in any other way. 
You
approved the Plan with the termination date of September 11, 2012 at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. You also approved the Plan and Amendment No. 1 with a termination date of
September 30, 2015, at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. You also approved the Plan and Amendment No. 2 with a termination date of September 30, 2018, at the 2016 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders. The Board of Directors requests your approval of the Plan, as extended to September 30, 2021 by Amendment No. 3, to preserve substantial tax assets of the Company. 






Description of the Plan  

The Plan is intended to help protect the Company's tax assets. Through year-end 2018, Ford had tax attributes, including research credits and foreign tax
credits, that would offset more than $40 billion of taxable income. We can utilize the tax attributes in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce our federal income tax
liability. Our ability to use the tax attributes would be substantially limited if there were an "ownership change" as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code") and the Internal Revenue Service rules. 


The
Plan is intended to reduce the risk of an "ownership change" under Section 382 of the Code by deterring any person or group from becoming or obtaining the right to become a "5-percent
shareholder" (as such term is used in Section 382) or, in certain cases, increasing such person's or group's ownership of Common Stock beyond 4.99%,
without the approval of the Board of Directors. In general, an ownership change would occur if Ford's "5-percent shareholders" collectively increase their ownership in Ford by more than
50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If any person or group acquires 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (subject to certain exceptions), there would be a
triggering event under the Plan which could result in significant dilution in the ownership interest of such person or group in Ford stock. As such, the Plan has anti-takeover effects. 
The
description of the Plan contained in this Proposal 4 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Plan, including Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, and Amendment
No. 3, and is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix I. You are urged to read carefully the Plan in its entirety as the discussion herein is only a
summary.
The Rights.    On September 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Ford declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and Class B stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Stock"), of the
Company. The dividend was paid on September 25, 2009 to stockholders of record on that date (the "Record Date"). Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a
share of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Plan. Until it is exercised or exchanged, a Right does not give its
holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including without limitation any dividend, voting or liquidation rights. 
Preferred Stock.    Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly
dividend payment of the greater of

dividends), and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with
the Common Stock and Class B Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock are converted or
exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock. These rights are protected by customary
anti-dilution provisions. Shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. 
Because
of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each
Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock. 
Exercisability.    The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public
announcement that a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) 10 business days after the
date of commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding shares of
Common Stock (the earlier of such dates called the "Distribution Date"). Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates or
Class B Stock certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock or Class B Stock) outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate or Class B
Stock certificate (or such book entry shares) together with a notation to that effect. 
Until
the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred only with the Common Stock and the Class B Stock. Until the Distribution Date, new Common Stock certificates and Class B Stock
certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock and Class B Stock) issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuances of Common Stock and Class B Stock, as
applicable, will contain a notation incorporating the Plan by reference and, with respect to 


any
uncertificated book entry shares issued after the Record Date, proper notice will be provided that incorporates the Plan by reference. 
In
the event that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price. 
Exchange.    At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or
group of 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock, the Board of Directors may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or
group, which will have become void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred Stock of
equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). 
Expiration.    Pursuant to the Plan amended as of September 13, 2018, the Rights will expire upon the earliest to occur of
the following:

 the close of business on September 30, 2021 (unless that date is advanced or extended); 
 the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Plan; 
 the final adjournment of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders if shareholder approval of the Plan has not been received prior to
that time; 
 the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the
preservation of the Company's tax benefits; or 
 the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward. 
Anti-Dilution Provisions.    The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable, upon exercise of
the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a reclassification, subdivision or combination of, the Preferred Stock;
(ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with
a conversion price, less than the then-current

price of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or
dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants. No adjustments to the purchase price of less than 1% will be made. The Rights are also subject to adjustment in the event
of a stock dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, or subdivisions, consolidation or combinations of the Common Stock
occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date. 
Redemption.    At any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of the adoption of the Plan
(the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
Immediately upon any 


redemption
of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price. 
Amendments.    For so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend
the Plan in any manner. After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner that does not adversely affect the
interests of holders of the Rights. 
"RESOLVED: the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated September 11, 2009 and as amended by Amendment No. 1 effective September 11,
2012, as amended by Amendment No. 2 effective September 9, 2015, and as amended by
Amendment No. 3 effective September 13, 2018, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, as described in this Proposal 4 and attached as
Appendix I to this Proxy Statement, is approved."

Shareholder Proposals
We expect the following proposals to be presented by shareholders at the
annual meeting. Following SEC rules, other than minor formatting changes, we are reprinting the proposals and supporting statements as they were submitted to us. Each of the proposals contains
assertions about the Company or other statements that we believe are incorrect. We have not attempted to refute all of these inaccuracies and take no responsibility for the content of the proposals.
The Board of Directors has thoroughly considered each proposal and recommends a vote AGAINST these proposals for the reasons set forth following each proposal. 


Proposal 5. Shareholder Proposal  
Mr. John
Chevedden of 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, who owns 500 shares of common stock, has informed the Company that the following proposal will be
presented at the meeting: 




Proposal 5  Equal Voting Rights for Each Share  
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that our Board take steps to ensure that all of our company's outstanding stock has an equal one-vote per share in each voting
situation. This would encompass all practicable steps including encouragement and negotiation with current and future shareholders, who have more than one vote per share, to request that they
relinquish, for the common good of all shareholders, any preexisting rights, if necessary. 
This
proposal is not intended to unnecessarily limit our Board's judgment in crafting the requested change in accordance with applicable laws and existing contracts. 
Ford
Family shares have 36-votes per share compared to the tiny one-vote per share for regular shareholders. (Some reports say 16-votes per share.) This dual-class voting stock reduces accountability
by allowing corporate control to be retained by insiders disproportionately to their money at risk. 
The
onerous Ford requirement for 30% of shares to call a special meeting of shareholders further compounds this. This is when state law allows 10% of shares to call a special shareholder meeting and
scores of Fortune 500 companies (with equal voting rights) allow 10%. Plus Ford took away our right to an in-person annual meeting and sends a message that in-person contact with shareholders is a
nuisance. 
This
proposal topic has received more than 51% of the independent vote of the non-family Ford stock in each year since 2011. 
In
spite of such consistent 2011 to 2018 support from regular Ford shareholders  Ford management has done absolutely nothing to address this serious
issue  not even one baby step. It is time that the 63-year practice (1956-2019) of disenfranchising Ford public shareholders is changed for the common benefit of
all shareholders. 
Corporate
governance advocates as well as many investors and index managers have pushed back on the Ford-type dual-class structures. Last year, S&P Dow Jones Indices said that companies with multiple
classes of shares would be barred from entering its flagship S&P 500 index. 
As
an example for Ford, social and mobile-game maker Zynga announced moving to a single-class share structure in 2018. Zynga executives said in a letter to its shareholders that a single-class share
structure simplifies the company's stock structure and gives parity to shareholders. In its 2018 annual report, Zynga said its old multi-class share system could limit the ability of its other
stockholders to influence the company and could negatively impact its share price. 
Please
vote yes:

The
Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 5 because it is not in the best interests of Ford and you. 
The
Ford family has more than an 115-year history of significant involvement in the affairs of the Company; they are bound to the Company not just in an economic sense through Class B shares
but also on the basis of heritage, stewardship, and loyalty. Members of the Ford family always have played an important role in the Company both before and after it went public in 1956. As a direct
result of the dual-class structure, the Ford family has a special interest in the long-term success of the Company and provides stability in the face of short-term market pressures and outside
influences. This structure also ensures that the Company has a solid and loyal investor base throughout economic downturns and crises. 
Through
their actions during the past century, the Ford family has proven that the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders has been, and continues to be, the primary
purpose of their involvement. This long-term focus is essential for sustained success in our industry. Never was this more evident than during the financial crisis. With the unwavering support of the
Class B shareholders, Ford was able to maintain a resolute focus on accelerating its plans, not just to survive the crisis while protecting your interests as shareholders rather than going
through bankruptcy proceedings, but also to build the foundation necessary to establish sustainable and profitable growth for all. 
Moreover,
the current capital structure has been in place since Ford became a public company in 1956; it was the basis on which those who owned the Company were willing to offer shares to the public
and, in the words of the January 17, 1956 Prospectus, "relinquish their exclusive right to vote in the affairs of management." Every purchaser of a share of Ford's common stock since that time
has done so based on full disclosure that the Company has two classes of voting stock, consisting of common stock (representing 60% of the voting power), and Class B Stock (representing 40% of
the voting power). Indeed, we believe many purchasers of Ford stock are attracted to it because of the dual-class structure, as discussed above. Under
the banner of "equal vote," therefore, the proposal actually seeks to upend the 63-year relationship among the Company's shareholders by ignoring the foundational compact on which that relationship
was formed as well as the fundamental equitable interests that holders of both classes of stock established by their reliance on that structure. 
Of
course, neither history alone nor even the unfairness of upending the shareholders' compact would justify continuing the Company's capital structure if there were any demonstration that the
interests of shareholders were being harmed because of that structure. But the proponent of the proposal demonstrates nothing of the sort and could not do so. On the contrary, your interests as
shareholders have been and will continue to be well served by the Company's longstanding capital structure. 
Shareholders,
however, need not rely just on capital structure or history to conclude that the proposal is unnecessary at best, for your interests as shareholders have long been protected within this
structure through the Company's adherence to sound corporate governance practices and principles that complement the share capital structure and
reinforce the Company's strong commitment to both long-term sustainability and shareholder value. These corporate governance practices are often equal to, or better than, the practices of both single
and dual class companies. Among our robust corporate governance practices are the following:

 annual election of all directors by majority vote; 
 common shareholders have the majority voting power, in contrast to the majority of multi-class companies;  
 Class B shareholders do not have the right to elect any directors separately from common shareholders, in contrast to many dual-class
companies; 
 Common shareholders have the right to call special meetings; 
 ten of the thirteen director nominees are independent; 
 shareholders may act by written consent; and 
 the CEO and Chairman positions are separate, and the Board has a Lead Independent Director.

In
addition to these practices, we have instituted the Creating Value Roadmap Process as our primary risk management tool (see Board's Role in Risk Management on pp. 14-17). The Board has reviewed the
Creating Value Roadmap Process, and it has been institutionalized through a policy letter that is binding on all Business Units and Skill Teams. We continually review our enterprise risk management
processes and procedures with the goal of improving our assessment of, and response to, risks and opportunities. 
While
competing studies may provide conflicting analysis of the financial performance of dual-class companies generally Ford's performance over the past six years has been consistently profitable with
positive Company Operating Cash Flow. It is important to appreciate that, without accessing taxpayer money or going through a bankruptcy process that would have eliminated shareholder value, we
achieved each of the following and more:

 financed our plan by accessing the debt markets prior to the onset of the financial crisis; 
 invested in new products and technologies that allowed us to emerge from the crisis with the freshest product portfolio in the industry and
positioned ourselves to maintain that leadership position; 
 retained our interest in Ford Motor Credit Company, our strategically important finance company; 
 paid back our secured financing by returning to profitability and maintaining consistent profits and cash flow;  
 returned to an investment grade credit rating by the four major credit rating agencies that rate us;  
 reinstated a dividend in 2012, doubled the dividend rate in the first quarter of 2013; increased it by an additional 25% in the first quarter
of 2014; increased it a further 20%, to 15 cents per share per quarter (60 cents per share annually), in the first quarter of 2015; in January 2016, the Board approved the payment of a $0.25 per share
supplemental dividend in addition to the $0.15 per share regular quarterly dividend; in January 2017, the Board approved a payment of $0.05 per share supplemental dividend in addition to the $0.15 per
share regular quarterly dividend; in January 2018, the Board approved a payment of $0.13 per share supplemental dividend in addition to the $0.15 per share regular quarterly dividend; and in January
2019, the Board maintained the $0.15 per share regular dividend; and 
 returned approximately $18.4 billion to shareholders from 2012-2018 through dividends and share repurchase programs that offset the
dilutive effect of our share-based employee compensation plan and the conversions of senior convertible debt. 
Our
sustained financial performance and corporate governance practices indicate that the interests of all shareholders have been protected under the current structure. 
We
do not believe that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to corporate governance is appropriate, as best practices for cyclical businesses such as the auto industry may differ from those in other
industries. The Board believes that our ownership structure has helped insulate our Company from business cycles and related short-term pressures, while allowing the Board and senior management to
focus on our long-term success. 
In
short, the current share capital structure is in the best interests of the Company. The support of the Class B shareholders has provided significant stability to the business, and the long
history of Ford family involvement in the Company has been one of its greatest strengths. For the reasons stated above, the Board of Directors recommends a vote "against" this Proposal because it is
not in the best interests of Ford and you.

Proposal 6. Shareholder Proposal  
The
Unitarian Universalist Association of 24 Farnsworth Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, which owns 6,332 shares of common stock, has informed the Company that the following proposal will be
presented at the meeting: 
Resolved, Ford shareholders request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 


1.Company
policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.
2.Payments
by Ford used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment
and the recipient.
3.Description
of management's decision making process and the Board's oversight for making payments described in section 2 above. 

For
purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects
a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. "Indirect lobbying" is lobbying
engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Ford is a member. 
Both
"direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. 
The
report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on Ford's website. 




Supporting Statement  
We encourage transparency and accountability in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation, both directly and indirectly. Investors
participating in the climate Action 100+, representing $32 trillion in assets under management, seek enhanced disclosure demonstrating company alignment with the Paris Agreement. 
Ford
spent $42.9 million from 2010 - 2017 on federal lobbying (opensecrets.org). This figure does not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Ford
also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Ford spent $2,833,447 on lobbying in California from 2010 - 2017. Ford's lobbying over fuel efficiency standards has
attracted media scrutiny ("The Stunning Hypocrisy of U.S. Automakers," Nexus Media, May 8, 2018). 
Ford
sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce, which has spent more than $1.4 billion on lobbying since 1998, belongs to the Business Roundtable, which is lobbying against the right of
shareholders to file resolutions, and is a member of the Alliance of Automobiles Manufacturers, which spent over $15.5 million on lobbying for 2016 and 2017. Ford does not disclose its
memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. 
We
are concerned that Ford's lack of lobbying disclosure presents significant reputational risk when it contradicts the company's public positions. For example, Ford states that climate change is real
and it is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, yet the Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers has questioned climate science and
lobbied to weaken fuel standards, which will severely hamper the ability to meet climate goals and the Chamber opposed the Paris climate accord. As shareholders, we believe that companies should
ensure there is alignment between their own positions and their lobbying, including through trade associations.

The
Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 6 because it is not in the best interests of Ford and you. 
Corporations
are prohibited under federal and many state laws from making direct or indirect contributions to candidates or political parties. As a matter of policy, the Company does not make
contributions to political candidates or organizations, nor does it employ its resources for the purpose of helping to elect candidates to public office, even where permitted by law. 
The
Company has a political action committee, the Ford Civic Action Fund (the "Fund"). All of the contributions made by the Fund are derived from voluntary employee contributions; the Company makes no
contributions. The Company does pay the solicitation and administrative expenses of the Fund, however, these expenses are minimal, and are permitted by law. Information with respect to contributions
made by the Fund in connection with federal and state elections is publicly available from the Federal Election Commission and applicable state boards of election, respectively. 
In
addition, each quarter we file a publicly available federal Lobbying Disclosure Act report. The report provides specific information on all Ford activities associated with influencing
legislation through communications with any member or employee of a legislative body or with any covered executive branch office. The report also quantifies our expenditures for the quarter, describes
the specific pieces of legislation that were the subject of our lobbying efforts and identifies the individuals who lobbied on behalf of our Company. Outside consultants who lobby on our behalf also
file reports detailing their efforts on Ford's behalf. All of these reports are available from the websites of the Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the United States House of
Representatives. 
Where
permitted by law, the Company makes contributions with respect to state and local ballot questions and referenda that have a direct impact on the Company's business (such as those dealing with
local property taxes). Information with respect to contributions made in connection with ballot questions and referenda is publicly available through local boards of election. 
We
do not believe that the additional information requested by the proposal will add significant value for shareholders. To the extent the proposal would cover payments to tax exempt organizations
that in turn may engage in political activity, it should be noted that Ford belongs to many trade associations. These memberships provide significant benefits to the Company and shareholders.
Management is aware of the political activities of these organizations and ensures that any such activities further our corporate interests and thus your interests as shareholders. To produce the
detailed report requested by the proposal would require significant time and expense. The Board believes that these resources could be better utilized in moving our business forward and, consequently,
does not support the proposal.

Proposal 7. Shareholder Proposal  
Mercy
Investment Services, Inc., 2039 North Geyer Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63131, which owns 385 shares of common stock, has informed the Company that the following proposal will be
presented at the meeting: 
Ford Motor Company Political Disclosure Shareholder Resolution
Resolved, that the shareholders of Ford Motor Company ("Ford" or "Company") hereby request that the Company provide a report, updated semiannually,
disclosing the Company's: 


1.Policies
and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or indirect) to (a) participate or intervene in any
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum.
2.Monetary
and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including:


a.The
identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and
b.The
title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making. 


The
report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does
not encompass lobbying spending. 


Supporting Statement  
As long-term shareholders of Ford, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered
intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or
electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates. 
Disclosure
is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, "[D]isclosure
permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different
speakers and messages." 
Publicly
available records show Ford has contributed at least $3,400,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com; National
Institute on Money in State Politics: hyttp://www.followthemoney.org). 
However,
relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for
election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt
organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including United Technologies and Boeing, which present this
information on their websites. 
The
Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.

The
Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 7 because it is not in the best interests of Ford and you. 
Corporations
are prohibited under federal and many state laws from making direct or indirect contributions to candidates or political parties. As a matter of Company policy, the Company does not make
contributions to political candidates or organizations, nor does it employ its resources for the purpose of helping to elect candidates to public office, even where permitted by law. 
The
Company has a political action committee, the Ford Civic Action Fund (the "Fund"). All of the contributions made by the Fund are derived from voluntary employee contributions; the Company makes no
contributions. The Company does pay the solicitation and administrative expenses of the Fund, however, these expenses are minimal and are permitted by law. Information with respect to contributions
made by the Fund in connection with federal and state elections is publicly available from the Federal Election Commission and applicable state boards of election, respectively. 
Where
permitted by law, the Company makes contributions with respect to state and local ballot questions and referenda that have a direct impact on the Company's business (such as those dealing with
local property taxes). Information with respect to contributions made in connection with ballot questions and referenda is publicly available through local boards of election. 
We
do not believe that the additional information requested by the proposal will add significant value for shareholders. To the extent the proposal would cover payments to tax exempt organizations
that in turn may engage in political activity, it should be noted that Ford belongs to many trade associations. These memberships provide significant benefits to the Company and shareholders.
Management is aware of the political activities of these organizations and ensures that any such activities further our corporate interests and thus your interests as shareholders. To produce the
detailed report requested by the proposal would require significant time and expense. The Board believes that these resources could be better utilized in moving our business forward and, consequently,
does not support the proposal. 
Your Board's recommendation: AGAINST Proposal 7

Shareholder Proposals for 2020     
Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise, next year's annual meeting will be held on May 14, 2020. Any shareholder proposal
intended for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by the Company's Secretary no later than November 30, 2019, and can be sent via facsimile to
313-322-1200. Shareholder proposals submitted outside of the process described in Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will not be considered at any annual meeting of
shareholders. The Company will not include in the Notice of Annual Meeting proposals not in compliance with SEC Rule 14a-8 and, under the Company's By-Laws, no business other than that stated
in the notice of meeting can be transacted at the meeting. 
 
  



Annual Report and Other Matters     
Ford's 2018 Annual Report, including consolidated financial statements, has been mailed to you or can be viewed by following the instructions
on the Notice and Access letter received by you. A list of the shareholders of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting will be available for review by any shareholder, for any purpose related to
the meeting, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EDT at Ford Motor Company, World Headquarters, One American Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48126, for ten days prior to the meeting and on the day
of the meeting. The list will also be available to shareholders at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/FORD2019 during the annual meeting. 
 
  



Multiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Address     
If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock in "street name," your broker or bank may have sent you a notice
that your household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This practice is known as "householding," and is designed to reduce
our printing and postage costs. If, however, any shareholder residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate annual report, proxy statement, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials, he or she may contact his or her broker. For registered holders, he or she may telephone the Shareholder Relations Department at 800-555-5259 (US and Canada) or 313-845-8540 (international)
or write to them at Ford Motor Company, Shareholder Relations, P.O. Box 6248, Dearborn, MI 48126. 
 
  



Expenses of Solicitation     
Ford will pay the cost of soliciting proxies in the accompanying form. We do not expect to pay any fees for the solicitation of proxies, but
may pay brokers, nominees, fiduciaries, and other custodians their reasonable fees and expenses for sending proxy materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their instructions. In addition to
solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited in person, by telephone, facsimile transmission, or other means of electronic communication by directors, officers, and other employees of the Company.

Questions and Answers About the Proxy Materials
 
  

WHAT ARE THE VOTING RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND CLASS  B STOCK?     


 Holders of common stock and holders of Class B Stock, as of close of business March 13, 2019, the record date, will vote together
without regard to class on the matters to be voted upon at the meeting. 
 Holders of common stock have 60% of the general voting power. Holders of Class B Stock have the remaining 40% of the general voting
power. 
 On March 13, 2019, 3,918,667,013 shares of common stock and 70,852,076 shares of Class B Stock were outstanding and, thus, are
eligible to be voted. 



 Each outstanding share of common stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon.  
 At this year's meeting, each outstanding share of Class B Stock will be entitled to 36.872 votes on each matter to be voted upon. The
number of votes for each share of Class B Stock is calculated each year in accordance with the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 


 
  

HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES?     


 Shares may be voted before the meeting by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card.  
 Shares may be voted at the meeting by completing a ballot online during the meeting. 
 Company employees or retirees participating in either of the Company's Savings and Stock Investment Plan for Salaried Employees or
Tax-Efficient Savings Plan for Hourly Employees, may be receiving this material because of shares held for you in those plans. In that case, you may use a proxy card to instruct the plan trustee on
how to vote those shares. The trustee will vote the shares in accordance with your instructions 



and
the terms of the plan. If you hold shares in any part of these plans, the trustee will vote the shares held for you even if you do not direct the trustee how to vote. In these cases, the trustee
will vote any shares for which the trustee does not receive instructions in the same proportion as the trustee votes the shares for which the trustee does receive instructions unless otherwise
required by ERISA as determined by the investment manager. To allow sufficient time for voting by trustees and administrators of the plans, your voting instructions must be received by
11:59 p.m. EDT on May 6, 2019. 



 
  

HOW CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?     

You can revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by:

 Submitting written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company; 



 Submitting another proxy by telephone, online, or by mail that is later dated and, if by mail, that is properly signed; or  
 Voting online during the meeting if you are a shareholder of record or a "street name" holder. 


 
  

WHAT IF I DO NOT SPECIFY HOW I WANT MY SHARES VOTED?     

If you do not specify on your proxy card (or when giving your proxy by telephone or online) how you want to vote your shares, we will vote them: 
FOR all of the director nominees (Proposal 1); 
FOR ratifying the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal 2); 


FOR approval of the compensation of the Named Executives (Proposal 3); 
FOR approval of the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (Proposal 4); and 
AGAINST the shareholder proposals (Proposals 5, 6, and 7).

 A majority of the votes that could be cast by shareholders who are either present online or represented by proxy at the meeting is required to
elect the nominees for director and to approve each proposal. 
 The votes are computed for each share as described on p. 84. 
 The total number of votes that could be cast at the meeting is the number of votes actually cast plus the number of abstentions.  
 Abstentions are counted as "shares present" at the meeting for purposes of determining whether a 



quorum
exists and have the effect of a vote "against" any matter as to which they are specified. 


 Proxies submitted by brokers that do not indicate a vote for some or all of the proposals because they don't have discretionary voting
authority and haven't received instructions as to how to vote on those proposals (so-called "broker non-votes") are not considered "shares present" and will not affect the outcome of the vote.

  TAX BENEFIT PRESERVATION PLAN   
Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of September 11, 2009 ("Plan"), between Ford Motor Company, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent"). 
The
Company has generated net operating loss carryovers and tax credit carryovers for United States federal income tax purposes ("NOLs"), which will potentially provide valuable Tax Benefits (as
defined below) to the Company. The ability to use the NOLs may be impaired or destroyed by an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382 (as defined below). The Company desires to
avoid such an "ownership change" and thereby preserve the ability to utilize the NOLs. In furtherance of such objective, the Company desires to enter into this Plan. 
The
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has adopted resolutions creating a series of preferred stock designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and
has authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) and one Right for each share of Class B Stock
(as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding as of the Close of Business (as defined below) on September 25, 2009 (the "Record Date"), each Right initially representing the right to
purchase one one-thousandth (subject to adjustment) of a share of Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined), upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized
and directed the issuance of one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) with respect to each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock that shall become outstanding between the Record
Date and the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined); provided, however, that Rights
may be issued with respect to shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock that shall become outstanding after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with
Section 22. 
Accordingly,
in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows: 
 
 
 Section 1.    Certain Definitions.     For purposes of this Plan, the following terms have the meaning
 indicated:
(a)   "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (other than any Exempt Person) that has become, in itself or, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such
Person, the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that any Existing Holder (as
defined below) will not be deemed to be an Acquiring Person for any purpose of this Plan on and after the date on which the adoption of this Plan is first publicly announced unless and until such time
as such Existing Holder acquires Beneficial Ownership of additional shares of Common Stock representing .5% of the Common Stock then outstanding, unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such
additional shares of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; provided,
further, that a Person will not be deemed to have become an Acquiring Person solely as a result of (i) a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding, (ii) the exercise of any options, warrants, rights or similar interests (including restricted stock) granted by the Company to its directors, officers and employees,
(iii) any unilateral grant of any security by the Company or any issuance by the Company of shares of its capital stock to such Person, or (iv) an Exempt Transaction, unless and until
such time as such Person thereafter acquires Beneficial Ownership of one additional share of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the
outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock), unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such
additional share of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. No Qualified Holder shall become an "Acquiring Person"
as a result of such Qualified Holder becoming the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock into which shares of Class B Stock are convertible or have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.4 of Article Fourth of the Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring
Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it
beneficially owned a percentage of Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person" or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial Ownership of
Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Plan), and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have
become an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of this Plan as a result of such inadvertent acquisition. In addition,  
​









​

 notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a), has become such as a result of an
acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock that the Board in its sole discretion determines in good faith, prior to the Distribution Date that would otherwise occur as a result of
such acquisition, will not jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company
of the NOLs, then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for purposes of this Plan as a result of such acquisition, unless and until such time as such Person
thereafter acquires Beneficial Ownership of one additional share of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or
Class B Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock or Class B Stock), unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional share of Common
Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or the Board determines otherwise in accordance with this sentence or the preceding
sentence. For all purposes of this Plan, any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including for purposes of determining the particular percentage of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and
Regulations under the Exchange Act (as defined below) as in effect on the date hereof.
(b)   "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Exchange Act, as in effect on the date hereof, and to the extent not included within the foregoing clause of this Section 1(b), shall also include, with respect to any Person, any other Person
(whether or not an Exempt Person) whose shares of Common Stock would be deemed constructively owned by such first Person, owned by a single "entity" as defined in Section 1.382-3(a)(1) of the
Treasury Regulations, or otherwise aggregated with shares owned by such first Person pursuant to the provisions of the Code, or any successor provision or replacement provisions to Section 382,
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed to be the Affiliate or Associate of another
Person solely because either or both Persons are or were directors of the Company.
(c)   A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of, shall be deemed to have "Beneficial Ownership" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any
securities:

(i)    which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, has the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing) (including any purchase orders for shares of Common Stock initiated
prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of this Plan) or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants, options, or other rights (in each case, other than upon
exercise or exchange of the Rights); provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of, or to "beneficially own"
securities (including rights, options or warrants) which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock until such time as such securities are converted or exchanged into or
exercised for Common Stock except to the extent the acquisition or transfer of such rights, options or warrants would be treated as exercised on the date of its acquisition or transfer under
Section 1.382-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations; provided, further, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to
beneficially own, securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for
purchase or exchange;
(ii)   which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, has or shares the right to vote or dispose of, or has "beneficial
ownership" of (as defined under Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act), including pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in
writing), but only if the effect of such agreement, arrangement or understanding is to treat such Persons as an "entity" under Section 1.382-3(a)(1) of the Treasury Regulations;
or
(iii)  of which any other Person is the Beneficial Owner, if such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (whether or not in writing) with such other Person (or any of such other Person's Affiliates or Associates) with respect to acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of such securities of
the
Company, but only if the effect of such agreement, arrangement or understanding is to treat such Persons as an "entity" under Section 1.382-3(a)(1) of the Treasury Regulations;
provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any security (A) if such Person
has the right to vote such security pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing) which (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to such
Person in response to a public proxy or

 consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D
or Schedule 13G under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report), or (B) if such Beneficial Ownership arises solely as a result of such Person's status as a "clearing
agency," as defined in Section 3(a)(23) of the Exchange Act; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 1(c) shall cause a
Person engaged in business as an underwriter of securities or member of a selling group to be the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any securities acquired through such Person's
participation in good faith in an underwriting syndicate until the expiration of 40 calendar days after the date of such acquisition, or such later date as the Board may determine in any specific
case. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent not within the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(c), a Person shall be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, and shall be
deemed to beneficially own or have Beneficial Ownership of, securities which such Person would be deemed to constructively own or which otherwise would be aggregated with shares owned by such Person
pursuant to Section 382 of the Code, or any successor provision or replacement provision and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

"Right Certificate"), evidencing one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) for each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock so held. As of and after the Distribution Date, the Rights
will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
(b)   As promptly as practicable following the Record Date, the Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Shares of Preferred Stock, in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Stock and Class B Stock as of the Close of
Business on the Record Date (other than any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate of any Acquiring Person), at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With respect to
certificates representing Common Stock and Class B Stock (or Book Entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock) outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the
Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof (or the Book Entry shares). Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date), the
surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Stock or Class B Stock (or any Book Entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock) outstanding on the Record Date shall also
constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock or Class B Stock represented by such certificate or Book Entry shares.
(c)   Rights shall be issued in respect of all shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock issued or disposed of after the Record Date but prior to the earlier
of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (or in certain circumstances provided in Section 22 hereof, after the Distribution Date). Certificates issued for Common Stock and
Class B Stock after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (or in certain circumstances provided in Section 22 hereof, after the
Distribution date) shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:

This
certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan between Ford Motor Company (the "Company") and Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of September 11, 2009 and as amended from time to time (the "Plan"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which
is on file at the principal executive offices of the Company. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Plan, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be
evidenced by this certificate. The Company will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Plan without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. Under certain
circumstances, as set forth in the Plan, Rights owned by or transferred to any Person who is or becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Plan) and certain transferees thereof will become null
and void and will no longer be transferable. 

With
respect to any Book Entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, such legend shall be included in a notice to the registered holder of such shares in accordance with applicable law. With
respect to certificates containing the foregoing legend, or any notice of the foregoing legend delivered to holders of Book Entry shares, until the Distribution Date the Rights associated with the
Common Stock or Class B Stock represented by such certificates or Book Entry shares shall be evidenced by such certificates or Book Entry shares alone, and the surrender for transfer of any
such certificate or Book Entry share, except as otherwise provided herein, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock and Class B Stock represented
thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or otherwise acquires any Common Stock or Class B Stock after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with
such Common Stock or Class B Stock shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock and
Class B Stock which are no longer outstanding. 
Notwithstanding
this paragraph (c), neither the omission of the legend required hereby, nor the failure to deliver the notice of such legend, shall affect the enforceability of any part of this
Plan or the rights of any holder of the Rights. 
 
 
 Section 4.    Form of Right Certificates.     The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase shares and of
 assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may
deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any
rule or regulation of the New York Stock Exchange or of any other stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or quoted, or to conform to usage.

shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right
Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the Person who signed such Right Certificates had
not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any Person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall

like number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (or, following such time, other securities, cash or assets as the case may be) as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates
surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in
writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the office or agency of the Rights Agent
designated for such purpose. Thereupon the Rights Agent, subject to the provisions of this Plan, shall countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates,
as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up,
combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
(b)   Subject to the provisions of this Plan, at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, upon receipt by the Company and the Rights
Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably
satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and
cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the
Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
 
 
 Section 7.    Exercise of Rights, Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights.

Certificate may, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and except as otherwise provided herein, exercise the Rights evidenced thereby in whole or in part upon surrender of the Right Certificate,

such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated
by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt of the cash requisitioned from the Company, promptly deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right
Certificate.
(d)   Except as otherwise provided herein, in case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all of the Rights evidenced thereby, a new
Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the exercisable Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly
authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
(e)   Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a
registered holder of Rights upon the occurrence of any purported transfer or exercise of Rights pursuant to Section 6 hereof or this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have
(i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of assignment or form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such transfer
or exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (for the purposes of this Section 7(e), as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 or
13d-5 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act), former Beneficial Owner and/or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.
 
 
 Section 8.    Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates.     All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of
 exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the
Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates shall
be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Plan. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall
so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the
Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy or cause to be destroyed such canceled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the
Company.

 Section 9.    Availability of Shares of Preferred Stock.     
(a)   The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock or any
shares of Preferred Stock held in its treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.
(b)   So long as the shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the time that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities)
issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or listed on any other national securities exchange or quotation system, the Company shall use
its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or listed
on any other national securities exchange or quotation system upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
(c)   From and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Company shall use its best efforts, if then necessary, to permit the issuance of shares of
Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of Rights, to register and qualify such shares
of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or
"Blue Sky" laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not available), cause such registration statement and qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such
registration and qualifications effective until the earlier of (x) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (y) the Expiration Date. The Company
may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities
Act and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as
a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless
the requisite qualification or exemption in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been declared
effective.
(d)   The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time
that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates therefor (subject to
payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
(e)   The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in
respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not,
however, be required to pay any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of
certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing
Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of any Rights
until any such tax or charge shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by that holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's
reasonable satisfaction that no such tax or charge is due.
 
 
 Section 10.    Preferred Stock Record Date.     Each Person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Stock is issued upon
 the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to
have become the holder of record of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly
surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes or charges) was made; provided, however, that if the date of
such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such
certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which such transfer books are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not
be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Stock for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends or

Section 11.    Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number and Kind of Shares and Number of  Rights.     The Purchase Price, the number
of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property purchasable upon exercise of each Right and
the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
(a)   (i)  In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Plan (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred
Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, (C) combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares of Preferred Stock or
(D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is
the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective
date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as the case may be, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the
holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such
date and at a time when the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company were open, the holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend,
subdivision, combination or reclassification.

(ii)   Subject to Section 24 of this Plan, and except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 11(a)(iii), in the event that
any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the then-current Purchase Price, in accordance with
the terms of this Plan and in lieu of shares of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock (or at the option of the Company, such number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock)
as shall equal the result obtained by multiplying (x) the then-current Purchase Price, by (y) the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right is then
exercisable and dividing the product of (x) and (y) by (z) 50% of the then-current per share market price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof)
on the date of the occurrence of such event; provided, however, that the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) and the number of shares of Common
Stock so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall thereafter be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with this Section 11 hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to
the contrary, however, from and after the time (the "Invalidation Time") when any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are beneficially owned by (x) any Acquiring Person
(or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the Invalidation Time or
(z) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Invalidation Time pursuant to either (I) a
transfer from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or
(II) a transfer that the Board has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this paragraph, and subsequent
transferees of such Persons, shall be void without any further action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this
Plan. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or
other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder. From and after the Invalidation Time, no
Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6 hereof that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and any
Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be canceled.
(iii)  The Company may at its option (or, if required to comply with its Certificate of Incorporation, shall) substitute for a share of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of Rights in accordance with the foregoing
subparagraph (ii) such number or fraction of shares of Preferred Stock (or, if required to comply with its Certificate of Incorporation, equivalent shares of its capital stock) having an
aggregate current market value

 equal to the current per share market price of a share of Common Stock. In the event that there shall be an insufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to
permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Board shall, with respect to such deficiency, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any
material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, (A) determine the excess of (x) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right in
accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the "Current Value") over (y) the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock
for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the time that the Acquiring Person became such (such excess, the "Spread"), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which
have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of Common Stock issuable in accordance with subparagraph (ii) upon exercise of the
Right and payment of the applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity securities of the Company
(including, without limitation, shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock which, by virtue of having dividend, voting and liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of the shares of
Common Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board to have substantially the same value as the shares of Common Stock (such shares of preferred stock and shares or fractions of shares of preferred
stock are hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents")), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets, or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having a value
which, when added to the value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction in
such Purchase Price), where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected in good faith by the Board;
provided, however, that if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty
(30) days following the date that the Acquiring Person became such (the "Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of such Purchase Price, shares of
Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or
cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If, within the thirty (30) day period referred to above the Board shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional
shares of Common Stock could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, then, if the Board elects, such thirty (30) day period may be extended to the extent necessary, but
not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such
thirty (30) day period, as it may be extended, is hereinafter called the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second
and/or third sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and the last sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii)
hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek
any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such second sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such
suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension
is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to
Section 11(d)(i)) on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date and the per share or fractional value of any "Common Stock Equivalent" shall be deemed to equal the current per share market price
of the Common Stock on such date. The Board may, but shall not be required to, establish procedures to allocate the right to receive shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Rights among
holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii).

(b)   In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them (for a period
expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock (or shares having similar rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Stock ("Equivalent
Preferred Shares")) or securities convertible into Preferred Stock or Equivalent Preferred Shares at a price per share of Preferred Stock or Equivalent Preferred Shares (or having a conversion price

 Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase
Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock and Equivalent Preferred Shares outstanding on such record
date plus the number of shares of Preferred Stock and Equivalent Preferred Shares
which the aggregate offering price of the total number of such shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at
such current market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock and Equivalent Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional
shares of Preferred Stock and/or Equivalent Preferred Shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible);
provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of
the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash,
the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and which shall be binding on the
Rights Agent. Shares of Preferred Stock and Equivalent Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such
adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the
Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(c)   In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in
connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a
dividend payable in Preferred Stock) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be
determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then-current per share market price of the Preferred
Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board whose determination shall be described in a
statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent) of the portion of such assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or
warrants applicable to one share of Preferred Stock, and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Preferred Stock; provided,
however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the
Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase
Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(d)   (i)
Except as otherwise provided herein, for the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of any security (a "Security" for
the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is
hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in the event that the current per share market price of the
Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or
securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security, and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for
such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day,
the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported by the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to
trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as reported in the principal consolidated
transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or
admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if on such date the Security is not so quoted or reported, the average of the high and low asked prices in the
over-the-counter market as reported by any system then in use, or, if not so quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the

 Security selected by the Board. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the
transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.

(ii)   For the purpose of any computation hereunder, if the Preferred Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Stock shall be
determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Stock is not publicly traded but the Common Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market
price" of the Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Stock as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) multiplied by the then
applicable Adjustment Number (as defined in and determined in accordance with the Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock). If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred Stock is publicly
traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent
and shall be binding on the Rights Agent.

(e)   No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price;
provided, however, that any adjustments not required to be made by reason of this Section 11(e) shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or share of
Common Stock or other share or security as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later
than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date. If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to
Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Preferred Stock, thereafter the
Purchase Price and the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable
to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(e), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m) and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10 and 14 hereof with
respect to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
(f)    All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the
adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as
provided herein.
(g)   Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the
calculations made in Sections 11(b) and 11(c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted
Purchase Price, that number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) obtained by (i) multiplying
(x) the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase
Price.
(h)   The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price or any adjustment made to the number of shares of Preferred Stock for which
a Right may be exercised pursuant to Section 11(a)(i), 11(b) or 11(c) hereof to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one one-thousandths of a share
of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths of
a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number
of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately
after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the
time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be
at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the
Company may, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of

adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date
of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment. Right
Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on
the record date specified in the public announcement.
(i)    Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of
the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock which were expressed in
the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder without effect on the Purchase Price payable to exercise a Right or the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the
exercise of a Right as provided herein.
(j)    Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock or other
shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly
and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock or other such shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
(k)   In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event,
the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other capital stock or
securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such
exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such
holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
(l)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11 to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to make such adjustments in the Purchase Price, in addition
to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that the Board in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or
subdivision of the Preferred Stock, issuance wholly for cash of any shares of Preferred Stock at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Stock or securities which by
their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Stock, dividends on Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to
hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(m)  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, in the event that at any time after the date of this Plan and prior to the Distribution Date, the
Company shall (i) declare and pay any dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in Common Stock or Class B Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or
consolidation of the Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend payable in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then, in any such
case, the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number
of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock following any such event shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with
each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding immediately following
the occurrence of such event.

(n)   The Company agrees that, after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date, it will not, except as permitted by Section 23, 24 or
27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the benefits
intended to be afforded by the Rights.
 
  Section 12.    Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of  Shares.     Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate
setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock, the
Class B Stock or the Preferred Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate (or if prior to the Distribution Date, to each
holder of a certificate representing shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock or Book Entry shares in respect thereof) in accordance with Section 26 hereof. The Rights Agent shall be
fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such
certificate. Any adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 11 hereof shall be effective as of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment.
 
 
 Section 13.    [Reserved].     
 
 
 Section 14.    Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.     
(a)   The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights (except prior to the Distribution Date in accordance with Section 11(n) hereof) or to
distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such
fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current
market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing
price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported
in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or, if the Rights are not listed or
admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national
securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not
so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by such system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not so quoted, the average of
the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the
Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board shall be used.
(b)   The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of
Preferred Stock) or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred
Stock) upon the exercise or exchange of Rights. Interests in fractions of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock may, at the election of the Company,
be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it; provided that such agreement shall provide
that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners (for the purposes of this Section 14(b), as
such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 or 13d-5 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional
shares of Preferred Stock that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such
Rights are exercised for shares of Preferred Stock as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one share of Preferred Stock. For the purposes of this
Section 14(b), the current market value of a share of Preferred Stock shall be the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for
the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
(c)   The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise or exchange of Rights. In lieu of such fractional shares

 of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised or exchanged for shares of Common Stock as herein provided an amount in
cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 11(d)(i) hereof), for the Trading Day immediately prior to
the date of such exercise or exchange.
(d)   The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise or
exchange of a Right (except as provided above).
 
 
 Section 15.    Rights of Action.     All rights of action in respect of this Plan, excepting the rights of action given to the
 Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are
vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Stock and Class B Stock); and any registered
holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock and Class B Stock), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right
Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock and Class B Stock), on such holder's own behalf and for such holder's own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and
maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate (or, prior to the
Distribution Date, such Common Stock and Class B Stock) in the manner provided in such Rights Certificate and in this Plan. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the
holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Plan and will be entitled to specific performance of the
obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Plan.
 
 
 Section 16.    Agreement of Right Holders.     Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the
 Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a
Right that:
(a)   prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be evidenced by a Right Certificate and will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the
Common Stock and Class B Stock;
(b)   after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the office or agency of
the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer;
(c)   the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock
certificate or Class B Stock certificate (or Book Entry shares in respect of Common Stock or Class B Stock)) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced
thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the Common Stock certificate or Class B Stock certificate (or notices provided to holders of Book
Entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock) made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to
Section 7(e) hereof, shall be affected by any notice to the contrary; and
(d)   notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other
Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Plan by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, judgment, decree or ruling (whether
interlocutory or final) issued by a court or by a governmental, regulatory, self-regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or
enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided, however, that the
Company must use its reasonable best efforts to have any such injunction, order, judgment, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.
 
 
 Section 17.    Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder.     No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be
 entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the
Preferred Stock or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise or exchange of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any
Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon
any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as
provided in this Plan), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Rights

 Section 18.    Concerning the Rights Agent.     
(a)   The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights
Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Plan and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company
also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the
Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Plan, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of
liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly.
(b)   The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its

genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 20
hereof.
 
 
 Section 19.    Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent.     
(a)   Any corporation or entity into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity
corporation or resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation or entity succeeding to the stock transfer or
corporate trust powers of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Plan without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto; provided that such corporation or entity would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of
Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Plan, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the
Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the
successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Plan.
(b)   In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have
been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force
provided in the Right Certificates and in this Plan.
 
 
 Section 20.    Duties of Rights Agent.     The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Plan upon the
 following terms and conditions, by all of which the
Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
(a)   The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company and/or the Board), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
(b)   Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Plan the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or
established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be
conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by the President and the Secretary of the Company (each, an "Authorized Officer") and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate
shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Plan in reliance upon such certificate.

(c)   The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct.
(d)   The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Plan or in the Right Certificates (except
its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e)   The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Plan or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution
hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any
covenant or condition contained in this Plan or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to
Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 23 and 24, or the ascertaining of
the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant
to Section 12, describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of
Preferred Stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Plan or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of Preferred Stock or other securities will, when issued, be validly
authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(f)    The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and
other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Plan.
(g)   The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person reasonably
believed by the Rights Agent to be one of the Authorized Officers of the Company, and to apply to such Authorized Officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be
liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such Authorized Officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any
application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent
under this Plan and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the
Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any
Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or
the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or
omitted.
(h)   The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the
Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were
not Rights Agent under this Plan. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i)    The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its
attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting
from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided, that reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
(j)    If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the
form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been completed to certify the holder is not an Acquiring Person (or an Affiliate or Associate thereof) or a
transferee thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.

  Section 21.    Change of Rights Agent.     The Rights Agent or any successor
Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Plan upon 30 days' notice in
writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail. In the event the transfer agency relationship in effect between the
Company and the Rights Agent terminates, the Rights Agent will be deemed to have resigned automatically and be discharged from its duties under this Plan as of the effective date of such termination,
and the Company shall be responsible for sending any required notice. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights
Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock, Class B Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following the
Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint
a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of
such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the
Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed
by the Company or by such a court, shall be (A) a corporation or other entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, which is authorized under
such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million or (B) an affiliate of a corporation or entity described in clause (A) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor
Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent
shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the
purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock or
Preferred Stock, and, following the Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this
Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the
case may be.
 
 
 Section 22.    Issuance of New Right Certificates.     Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or of the Rights to
 the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right
Certificates evidencing Rights in such forms as may be approved by its Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or
property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock
following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may with respect to shares of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock so issued or sold pursuant to (i) the
exercise of stock options, (ii) under any employee plan or arrangement, (iii) the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Company or
(iv) a contractual obligation of the Company, in each case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with
such issuance or sale.
 
 
 Section 23.    Redemption.     
(a)   The Board may, at any time prior to such time as any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at
a redemption price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring in respect of the Common Stock after the date hereof (the
"Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. The Company may, at its
option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of Common Stock (based on the current market price of the Common Stock at the time of redemption as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i)
hereof) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board.
(b)   Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 23 (or at such later
time as the Board may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right
thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any

redemption. Within 10 days after such action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights (or such later time as the Board may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), the
Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the
Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives
the notice. Each such notice of redemption shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. The failure to give notice required by this Section 23(b) or any
defect therein shall not affect the validity of the action taken by the Company.
(c)   In the case of a redemption under Section 23(a) hereof, the Company may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to the Rights by
(i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the Rights and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of the Rights at their last
addresses as they appear on the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent of the Common Stock, and upon such action, all
outstanding Right Certificates shall be void without any further action by the Company.
 
 
 Section 24.    Exchange.     
(a)   The Board may, at its option, at any time after any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights (which shall
not include Rights that have not become effective or that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share
of Common Stock (or one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof
(such amount per Right being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring
Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock and/or Class B Stock aggregating 50% or more of the voting power of the shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock then
outstanding. The exchange of the Rights by the Board may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Prior to effecting an
exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Board may direct the Company to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board shall then approve (the "Trust Agreement").
If the Board so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "Trust") all of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to
the exchange, and all Persons entitled to receive shares pursuant to the exchange shall be entitled to receive such shares (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such
shares are deposited in the Trust) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.
(b)   Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24
and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange and shall promptly
mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of the Rights so exchanged at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent;
provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. Any notice which is
mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of
Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of
Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
(c)   The Company may at its option substitute, and, in the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized
but unissued (and unreserved) to permit an exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24 (or if the issuance of Common Stock in exchange for any Rights would not
otherwise be permitted under the Certificate of Incorporation), the Company shall substitute, to the extent of such insufficiency or to the extent necessary to comply with its Certificate of
Incorporation, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock or fraction thereof (or Equivalent Preferred Shares, as
such term is defined in Section 11(b), or other equivalent shares of its capital stock) such that the current per share market price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of one
share of Preferred

to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of such exchange.
 
 
 Section 25.    Notice of Certain Events.     
(a)   In case the Company shall at any time after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date propose (i) to pay any dividend payable
in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Stock or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Preferred Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer
to the holders of its Preferred Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional shares of Preferred Stock or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or
options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Stock (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision or combination of outstanding Preferred Stock), (iv) to
effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or (v) to declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in Common Stock or Class B
Stock, to effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Stock or Class B Stock), then, in each
such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the
purposes of such stock dividend or distribution or offering of rights or warrants, or the date on which such liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reclassification, subdivision, combination or
consolidation is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Stock, Class B Stock and/or Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice
shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Preferred Stock for
purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders
of the Common Stock, Class B Stock and/or Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.
(b)   In case any event described in Section 11(a)(ii) shall occur then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right
Certificate (or if occurring prior to the Distribution Date, the holders of the Common Stock and Class B Stock) in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such
event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii).
(c)   The failure to give notice required by this Section 25 or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the action taken by the Company or the
vote upon any such action.

 any holders of the Rights. At any time when the Rights are no longer redeemable, except as otherwise provided in this Section 27, the Company may, and the Rights Agent shall, if the Company so
directs, supplement or amend this Plan without the approval of any holders of Rights, in order to (i) cure any ambiguity, (ii) correct or supplement any provision contained herein which
may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, (iii) shorten or lengthen any time period hereunder, or (iv) change or supplement the provisions hereunder in any
manner which the Company may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such supplement or amendment may adversely affect the
interests of the holders of Rights as such (other than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person), and no such amendment may cause the Rights again to become redeemable
or cause this Plan again to become amendable other than in accordance with this sentence. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, no supplement or amendment shall be made
which decreases the Redemption Price. Upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company which states that the supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of
this Section 27, the Rights Agent shall promptly execute such supplement or amendment, provided that any supplement or amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties or obligations of
the Rights Agent under this Plan. The Rights Agent hereby acknowledges that in all matters arising under this Plan, including any amendment hereto pursuant to this Section 27, time is of the
essence.
 
 
 Section 28.    Successors.     All the covenants and provisions of this Plan by or for the benefit of the Company or the Rights
 Agent shall bind and inure to the benefit
of their respective successors and assigns hereunder.
 
 
 Section 29.    Benefits of this Plan.     Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to give to any Person other than the Company,
 the Rights Agent and the registered holders of the
Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock and Class B Stock) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Plan; but this Plan shall be for the sole
and exclusive benefit of the Company, the Rights Agent and the registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock and Class B
Stock).
 
 
 Section 30.    Process to Seek Exemption.     Any Person who desires to effect any acquisition of Common Stock that would, if
 consummated, result in such Person (together with its
Affiliates and Associates) beneficially owning 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of an Existing Holder, additional shares of Common Stock representing .5% or more of
the then-outstanding Common Stock) (a "Requesting Person") may, prior to the Stock Acquisition Date and in accordance with this Section 30, request that the Board grant an exemption with
respect to such acquisition under this Plan so that such acquisition would be deemed to be an "Exempt Transaction" for purposes of this Plan (an "Exemption Request"). An Exemption Request shall be in
proper form and shall be delivered by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company. To be in proper form, an Exemption
Request shall set forth (i) the name and address of the Requesting Person, (ii) the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by the Requesting Person,
together with all Affiliates and Associates of the Requesting Person, and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the transaction or transactions by which the Requesting Person would propose
to acquire Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock aggregating 4.99% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of an Existing Holder, additional shares of Common Stock representing
.5% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock) and the maximum number and percentage of shares of Common Stock that the Requesting Person proposes to acquire. The Board shall make a determination
whether to grant an exemption in response to an Exemption Request as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days) after receipt thereof;
provided, that the failure of the Board to make a determination within such period shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of the Exemption Request. The
Board shall only grant an exemption in response to an Exemption Request if the Board determines in its sole discretion that the acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock by the Requesting
Person will not jeopardize or endanger the availability to the Company of the NOLs. Any exemption granted hereunder may be granted in whole or in part, and may be subject to limitations or conditions
(including a requirement that the Requesting Person agree that it will not acquire Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock in excess of the maximum number and percentage of shares approved by
the Board), in each case as and to the extent the Board shall determine necessary or desirable to provide for the protection of the Company's NOLs. Any Exemption Request may be submitted on a
confidential basis and, except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Exemption Request and the Board's determination with respect thereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to its option to make payments in Common Stock in lieu of cash to the VEBA, as provided in Section 1(t) hereof,
shall be deemed an Exempt Transaction without reference to the requirements and process of this Section 30.

 Section 31.    Determinations and Actions by the Board of Directors.     The Board shall have the exclusive power and authority
 to administer this Plan and to exercise the rights and powers specifically granted
to the Board or to the Company, or as may be necessary or advisable in the administration of this Plan, including, without limitation, the right and power to (i) interpret the provisions of
this Plan and (ii) make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan (including, without limitation, a determination to redeem or not redeem the Rights
or to amend or not amend this Plan). All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations that are done or made by the Board in good faith shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Company, the Rights Agent, the holders of the Rights, as such, and all other parties.
 
 
 Section 32.    Severability.     If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Plan or applicable to this Plan is
 held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if any such term, provision,
covenant or restriction is held by such court or authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable and the Board determines in its good faith judgment that severing the invalid language from this Plan
would adversely affect the purpose or effect of this Plan, the right of redemption set forth in Section 23 hereof shall be reinstated (with prompt notice to the Rights Agent) and shall not
expire until the close of business on the tenth Business Day following the date of such determination by the Board. Without limiting the foregoing, if any provision requiring a specific group of
Directors of the Company to act is held by any court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, such determination shall then be made by the Board in accordance
with applicable law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
 
 
 Section 33.    Governing Law.     This Plan and each Right Certificate issued hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract made
 under the laws of the State of Delaware and
for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such State applicable to contracts to be made and performed entirely within such State.
 
 
 Section 34.    Counterparts.     This Plan may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall
 for all purposes be deemed to be an original,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. A signature to this Plan transmitted electronically shall have the same authority, effect and enforceability as an
original signature.
 
 
 Section 35.    Descriptive Headings.     Descriptive headings of the several sections of this Plan are inserted for convenience
 only and shall not control or affect the meaning or
construction of any of the provisions hereof.
 
 
 Section 36.    Force Majeure.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Rights Agent shall not be
 liable for any delays or failures in performance
resulting from acts beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, terrorist acts, shortage of supply, breakdowns or malfunctions, interruptions or malfunction of computer
facilities, loss of data due to power failures or mechanical difficulties with information storage or retrieval systems, labor difficulties, war or civil unrest.
IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Plan to be duly executed, all as of the day and year first above written.

    FORM OF       CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS       of       SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK       of       FORD MOTOR COMPANY
     Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation  Law of the State of Delaware   
FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DOES HEREBY
CERTIFY: 
That
pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") in accordance with the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the said
Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), the said Board of Directors on September 9, 2009 adopted the following resolution creating a series of 8,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock
designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock": 

RESOLVED,
that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of this Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation be and hereby is created, and that the designation and number of shares thereof and the voting and other powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other rights of the shares of such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are as follows: 

 Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock  
 
 
 1.    Designation and Amount.     There shall be a series of Preferred Stock that shall be designated as
 "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," and the
number of shares constituting such series shall be 8,000,000. Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall
reduce the number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to less than the number of shares then issued and outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise of
outstanding rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of outstanding securities issued by the Corporation.
 
 
 2.    Dividends and Distribution.    
(A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of
shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 1st day of March, June, September and December, in
each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10.00 or (b) the Adjustment Number (as
defined below) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and the Adjustment Number times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other
distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock"), or shares of Class B Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Corporation (the "Class B Stock"), or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock or
the Class B Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or
fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The "Adjustment Number" shall initially be 1,000.

 In the event the Corporation shall at any time after September 25, 2009 (i) declare and pay any dividend on Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or
Class B Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment
Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such
event.
(B)   The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above
immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock and Class B Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B
Stock).
(C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date; in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or
is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.
Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the
payment thereof.
 
 
 3.    Voting Rights.     The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
 shall have the following voting
rights:
(A)  Each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the Adjustment Number on all
matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.
(B)   Except as required by law, by Section 3(C) and by Section 10 hereof, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have
no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock as set forth herein) for taking
any corporate action.
(C)  If, at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the equivalent of six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive)
payable on any share or shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are in default, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased
by two. In addition to voting together with the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for the election of other directors of the Corporation, the holders of record of the Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, shall be entitled at said meeting of stockholders (and at
each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders), unless all dividends in arrears on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment prior
thereto, to vote for the election of two directors of the Corporation, the holders of any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock being entitled to cast a number of votes per share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as is specified in paragraph (A) of this Section 3. Each such additional director shall serve until the next annual meeting of
stockholders for the election of directors, or until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3(C). Until the default in payments of all dividends which permitted the election of said directors shall cease to exist, any director who shall have been so elected pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 3(C) may be removed at any time, without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at
the time entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of any such director at a special meeting of such holders called for that purpose, and any vacancy thereby
created may be filled by the vote of such holders. If and when such default shall cease to exist, the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be divested of the
foregoing special voting

 rights, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent like default in payments of dividends. Upon the termination of the foregoing special voting rights, the terms of office of all
persons who may have been elected directors pursuant to said special voting rights shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two.
The voting rights granted by this Section 3(C) shall be in addition to any other voting rights granted to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in this
Section 3.
 
 
 4.    Certain Restrictions.    
(A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in
Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

(i)    declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior
(either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
(ii)   declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity
stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or
(iii)  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a
parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all
holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or to such holders and holders of any such shares ranking on a parity therewith, upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after
consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable
treatment among the respective series or classes.

(B)   The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation
unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
 
 5.    Reacquired Shares.     Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased
 or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner
whatsoever shall be retired promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their retirement become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of
a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to any conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
 
 
 6.    Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.    
(A)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, voluntary or otherwise, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Series A Liquidation Preference") equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 plus an amount
equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or (ii) the Adjustment Number times the per share amount of all cash and
other property to be distributed in respect of the Common Stock and Class B Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
(B)   In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the
liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of stock of the Corporation, if any, that rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in respect thereof,
then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in
proportion to their respective liquidation preferences.

(C)  Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the
Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
 
 
 7.    Consolidation, Merger, Etc.     In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger,
 combination or other transaction in which the outstanding shares of
Common Stock and Class B Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share equal to the Adjustment Number times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash
and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock is changed or exchanged.
 
 
 8.    No Redemption.     Shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be
 subject to redemption by the
Corporation.
 
 
 9.    Ranking.     The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other
 series of the Preferred Stock as to the payment of
dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise, and shall rank senior to the Common Stock and
Class B Stock as to such matters.
 
 
 10.    Amendment.     At any time that any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
 are outstanding, the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation shall not be amended, by merger, consolidation or otherwise, which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, voting separately as a class.
 
 
 11.    Fractional Shares.     Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in
 fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder, in proportion to
such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock.

 SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK OF
FORD MOTOR COMPANY  
On September 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Ford Motor Company (the "Company") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and Class B Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Class B
Stock"). The dividend is payable on September 25, 2009 (the "Record Date") to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a
share of Preferred Stock (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, dated as of September 11, 2009,
as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent"). 
The
Plan is intended to help protect the Company's tax net operating loss carryforwards and have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that
attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights, as discussed more fully below. The Plan is intended to act
as a deterrent to any person or group from becoming or obtaining the right to become a "5-percent shareholder" (as such term is used in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) or, in certain cases, increasing such person's or group's ownership of Common Stock beyond a specified threshold, without the
approval of the Board of Directors. 
Until
the earlier to occur of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (with certain exceptions, an "Acquiring Person")
has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of
Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which
would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the
Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates or Class B Stock certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock or Class B Stock)
outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificate or Class B Stock certificate (or such book entry shares) together with this Summary of Rights. 
The
Plan provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Stock and the Class B Stock. Until the
Distribution Date (or earlier expiration of the Rights), new Common Stock certificates and Class B Stock certificates (or book entry shares in respect of the Common Stock and Class B
Stock) issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuances of Common Stock and Class B Stock, as applicable, will contain a notation incorporating the Plan by reference and, with
respect to any uncertificated book entry shares issued after the Record Date, proper notice will be provided that incorporates the Plan by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption
or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock (or book entry shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock)
outstanding as of the Record Date, even without a notation incorporating the Plan by reference (or such notice, in the case of Book Entry shares), notice or a copy of this Summary of Rights, will also
constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock represented by such certificate
or book entry shares, as the case may be. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to (or credited to
the account of) holders of record of the Common Stock and Class B Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.

Table of Contents
The
Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire upon the earliest of the close of business on September 11, 2012 (unless that date is advanced or extended),
the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Plan, the final adjournment of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders if stockholder approval of the Plan has not been
received prior to that time, the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company's
tax benefits, or the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which the Board determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward. 
The
Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent
dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of
certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of
the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in
Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). 
The
Rights are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend on the Common Stock and Class B Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock, or subdivisions,
consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date. 
Shares
of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly
dividend payment of the greater
of (a) $10.00 per share, and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of the greater of (a) $1.00 per share (plus any accrued but unpaid
dividends), and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with
the Common Stock and Class B Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock are converted or
exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock. These rights are protected by customary
anti-dilution provisions. 
Because
of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each
Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock. 
In
the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will
thereupon become void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times
the Purchase Price. 
At
any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and
Class B Stock, the Board of Directors may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock (or a series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges), at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred
Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). 
With
certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced
by depositary receipts), and in lieu thereof an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise. 
At
any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to
reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of adoption of the Plan (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such
time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in

sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the
Redemption Price. 
For
so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner. After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may,
except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Plan in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights. 
Until
a Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. 
A
copy of the Plan has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated September 11, 2009. A copy of the Plan is
available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, as the same may be amended
from time to time, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Forward-Looking Statements 




Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements  
Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation:

 Ford's long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of fitness actions; 
 Industry sales volume, particularly in the United States, Europe, or China, can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis,
recession, or significant geopolitical event; 
 Ford's new and existing products and mobility services are subject to market acceptance; 
 Ford's results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States;  
 Ford may face increased price competition resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, or other factors;  
 Fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates can have a significant effect on results;  
 With a global footprint, Ford's results could be adversely affected by economic, geopolitical, protectionist trade policies, or other events,
including Brexit; 
 Ford's production, as well as Ford's suppliers' production, could be disrupted by labor disputes, natural or man-made disasters, financial
distress, production difficulties, or other factors; 
 Ford's ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints;  
 Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford's liquidity and financial condition;  
 Economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns)
could be worse than Ford has assumed; 
 Ford's vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs;  
 Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, and other regulations that may change
in the future; 
 Ford could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in
products, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; 
 Ford's receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; 
 Operational systems, security systems, and vehicles could be affected by cyber incidents; 
 Ford Credit's access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be
affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; 
 Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes
for leased vehicles; 
 Ford Credit could face increased competition from banks, financial institutions, or other third parties seeking to increase their share of
financing Ford vehicles; and 
 Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer or data protection regulations, or other regulations. 
We
cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that
there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or
revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" above.
